    "StanceontheMatter": "Support",
    "Comments": "As a current mathematics teacher in CA public schools, and a former\nstudent in the CA public education system, I am writing to express my support\nfor the proposed California Math Framework. The framework provides appropriate\nguidance for districts, schools, and teachers to implement the common core\nstandards for mathematics, placing a focus on diversity, equity, and deep\nunderstanding of mathematics.\nI am aware of numerous criticisms of the framework, and would like to speak to a\nfew of these criticisms and why I believe they should be taken with a grain of\nsalt when considering the goals for the future of California mathematics\neducation. Firstly, many criticisms rely on analysis and criticisms written by\nBrian Conrad of the Stanford Mathematics Department. I attended Stanford\nUniversity as an undergraduate in the late 2010s. During my time at Stanford,\nConrad was a professor and director of undergraduate studies. Unfortunately, my\nexperience with mathematics at Stanford revealed that the Stanford Math\nDepartment has no interest in increasing diversity, equity, or deep\nunderstanding of mathematics. I entered my freshman year as a high achieving\nmath student, excited about mathematics and potentially interested in a major,\nbut my first day of class made me feel alienated, incompetent, and discouraged.\nNot because I was truly unqualified, but because the professor made it clear\nthat asking questions would be interpreted as stupidity, that he expected the\nmajority of us to fail the class, and that mathematics was an elite field meant\nonly for some. Throughout my first year, I learned more about the math\ndepartment that only supported these initial impressions -- particularly that\nthere were nearly no faculty or lecturers who were women or people of color, and\nthat the department building had only recently installed its first women\u0027s\nrestroom. I chose to major in chemistry instead of mathematics so that I could\ncontinue exploring advanced mathematical ideas, but apart from the mathematics\ndepartment. I still maintain that had I attended a different university, I would\nhave likely majored in mathematics, but Stanford was not a welcoming place to do\nso. I bring my experience to your attention in order to underscore that though\nBrian Conrad may have interest in the subject, he has little to no authority to\nspeak on mathematics education, and within his own field of influence, he has\nbeen a part of creating a space that is antithetical to the goals of the CA math\nframework. I am sure that we do not want CA students to feel alienated,\nincompetent, and discouraged when experiencing math class, and I feel that the\nmath framework would allow us to move in a positive direction.\nAnother criticism of the framework relates to the framework\u0027s advice on limiting\ntracking and acceleration in mathematics. As both a teacher and mathematics\nstudent who experienced acceleration, I can speak to the extreme negative\neffects it can have, not only creating significant gaps in understanding, but\nalso causing students to \u0027burn out\u0027 on math, instead of fostering a love and joy\nthat can last throughout college and career. Specifically, some criticisms argue\nthat advice against acceleration are holding students back, and that prior to\ncommon core, all students used to take algebra in 8th grade, but now that is\npushed to high school. I personally took \u0027algebra\u0027 in 8th grade under the\nstandards preceding common core, and much of the 8th grade math curriculum under\ncommon core matches up with what was taught in \u0027algebra.\u0027 By contrast, the high\nschool Algebra curriculum under common core is much more rigorous and requires\nmuch deeper understanding and fluency of connections between ideas than what was\npreviously accepted. It is important for us as educators to focus on ensuring\nstudents have strong, interconnected and flexible understandings of mathematics\n- this is unfortunately lost when we allow for rampant acceleration. Because of\nthis, I appreciate the framework\u0027s advice on limiting acceleration and I am\nhopeful for how it will support schools and districts in creating pathways that\nprioritize students\u0027 deep understanding.\nI am thankful for the work that has gone into creating and revising the\nMathematics Framework over the past 3 years. I urge the board to adopt the\nframework so that we can move forward into implementing what is best for CA math\nstudents. ",

        "StanceontheMatter": "Support",
        "Comments": "As a current mathematics teacher in CA public schools, and a former\nstudent in the CA public education system, I am writing to express my support\nfor the proposed California Math Framework. The framework provides appropriate\nguidance for districts, schools, and teachers to implement the common core\nstandards for mathematics, placing a focus on diversity, equity, and deep\nunderstanding of mathematics.\nI am aware of numerous criticisms of the framework, and would like to speak to a\nfew of these criticisms and why I believe they should be taken with a grain of\nsalt when considering the goals for the future of California mathematics\neducation. Firstly, many criticisms rely on analysis and criticisms written by\nBrian Conrad of the Stanford Mathematics Department. I attended Stanford\nUniversity as an undergraduate in the late 2010s. During my time at Stanford,\nConrad was a professor and director of undergraduate studies. Unfortunately, my\nexperience with mathematics at Stanford revealed that the Stanford Math\nDepartment has no interest in increasing diversity, equity, or deep\nunderstanding of mathematics. I entered my freshman year as a high achieving\nmath student, excited about mathematics and potentially interested in a major,\nbut my first day of class made me feel alienated, incompetent, and discouraged.\nNot because I was truly unqualified, but because the professor made it clear\nthat asking questions would be interpreted as stupidity, that he expected the\nmajority of us to fail the class, and that mathematics was an elite field meant\nonly for some. Throughout my first year, I learned more about the math\ndepartment that only supported these initial impressions -- particularly that\nthere were nearly no faculty or lecturers who were women or people of color, and\nthat the department building had only recently installed its first women's\nrestroom. I chose to major in chemistry instead of mathematics so that I could\ncontinue exploring advanced mathematical ideas, but apart from the mathematics\ndepartment. I still maintain that had I attended a different university, I would\nhave likely majored in mathematics, but Stanford was not a welcoming place to do\nso. I bring my experience to your attention in order to underscore that though\nBrian Conrad may have interest in the subject, he has little to no authority to\nspeak on mathematics education, and within his own field of influence, he has\nbeen a part of creating a space that is antithetical to the goals of the CA math\nframework. I am sure that we do not want CA students to feel alienated,\nincompetent, and discouraged when experiencing math class, and I feel that the\nmath framework would allow us to move in a positive direction.\nAnother criticism of the framework relates to the framework's advice on limiting\ntracking and acceleration in mathematics. As both a teacher and mathematics\nstudent who experienced acceleration, I can speak to the extreme negative\neffects it can have, not only creating significant gaps in understanding, but\nalso causing students to 'burn out' on math, instead of fostering a love and joy\nthat can last throughout college and career. Specifically, some criticisms argue\nthat advice against acceleration are holding students back, and that prior to\ncommon core, all students used to take algebra in 8th grade, but now that is\npushed to high school. I personally took 'algebra' in 8th grade under the\nstandards preceding common core, and much of the 8th grade math curriculum under\ncommon core matches up with what was taught in 'algebra.' By contrast, the high\nschool Algebra curriculum under common core is much more rigorous and requires\nmuch deeper understanding and fluency of connections between ideas than what was\npreviously accepted. It is important for us as educators to focus on ensuring\nstudents have strong, interconnected and flexible understandings of mathematics\n- this is unfortunately lost when we allow for rampant acceleration. Because of\nthis, I appreciate the framework's advice on limiting acceleration and I am\nhopeful for how it will support schools and districts in creating pathways that\nprioritize students' deep understanding.\nI am thankful for the work that has gone into creating and revising the\nMathematics Framework over the past 3 years. I urge the board to adopt the\nframework so that we can move forward into implementing what is best for CA math\nstudents. ",
