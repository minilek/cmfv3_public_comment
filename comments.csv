non-math as possible.
'encourage equitable outcomes'
'teaching toward social justice'
The government education system has failed miserably at teaching actual math, so
it's deciding to teach other topics in 'math' class.
This is despicable and actual MATH must ONLY be taught in class. ‚ÄúEquity‚Äù has
nothing to do with educating any person on how to perform math equations. No one
person is better at math due to their sex, gender, religion, etc. Stick to
numerical formulas that are proven science based equations and all persons will
be given equal treatment from their respective teachers. Teachers & staff making
up instructional material instead of proven factual mathematical data are the
problem and need to be dealt with accordingly if they are implementing
non-related or biased material, aka fired. I oppose all material dealing with

sued SFUSD on similar grounds for similar practices (FLENTJE v SFUSD,

Violating these Ed Codes is an unavoidable consequence of forcing a wide span of

UC-accredited outside education in order to avoid being held back in math.

providing our students with a comprehensive and coherent curriculum. By
emphasizing the development of mathematical proficiency, problem-solving skills,
and conceptual understanding, the framework ensures that our students are
equipped with the necessary tools to succeed in the 21st century.

I am particularly pleased to see the integration of technology and real-world
applications in the revised framework. Bringing relevance to students in today's
digital age, is crucial so that our students are not only proficient in
mathematical concepts but also capable of applying them in practical situations.

Furthermore, it will support our students to have a world size heart and a world
class mind. It will open up opportunities for collaboration and exchange of
ideas with educators from around the world. It also provides a clear roadmap for
educators to follow, facilitating consistency and coherence in mathematics
instruction across different schools and districts.

I am also pleased that it includes guidance on approaches to teaching and
learning, assessment methods, and professional development for teachers. By
providing teachers with the necessary support and resources, the framework
ensures that they are equipped to deliver high-quality mathematics instruction.
This, in turn, will have a positive impact on student outcomes and overall
educational attainment.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics
Framework for California Public Schools and commend the efforts being made to
enhance mathematics education. I believe that this will have a profound and
lasting impact on our all students through equity, equipping them with the
skills and knowledge they need to excel in mathematics and beyond.

Thank you for your dedication to providing equal opportunity for all students to
learn. I trust that you will consider my support for the adoption of the 2023
Mathematics Framework and take it into account as you continue to shape the
future of mathematics education in our state.

Yours sincerely,

Carol,retired math teacher,,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve.",Support,"I support the approval of the mathematics framework. Equity is an
important goal in math education. During my years in the classroom, I was able
to provide deep understanding to a wide variety of students enrolled in the same
course. At the same time, their different ways of learning and understanding
often benefited each other -- the connection between more concrete and more
abstract thinking became visible to everyone, rather than the struggling
students becoming mired in the concrete, and the stronger students relying on
memorization of procedures. Most of my students went on to good four year
colleges, including UCs and highly competitive private schools. After high
school when I saw them in the community, or when they wrote to me, they would
tell me that they felt well prepared in a multi-level math class for their
college curriculums.

Another thing I would like to point out is that standardized tests (aside from
IB/AP tests) aren't a good measure of what students know because they are
designed to compare students, not as mastery tests. Given that current students
had at least two disrupted academic years because of Covid (and don't forget
that many lost family members, and/or experienced long illnesses of caregivers
or themselves), test outcomes are even more questionable than usual.

The point of math is that students learn it deeply enough to succeed in the next
class, and like math enough to continue taking it in College, or using it in the
workplace. Thus, I reiterate my support of the framework which will help achieve
that goal.

back advanced students benefits no one but harms all. In an attempt to keep
failing math students from feeling bad, they propose holding advanced students
back. This will not achieve the desired effect. Failing students will still feel

what they learn and we have some fun in the process too! Covid definitely made
things clear for us all and sent many packing! I am still here, so are my
colleagues, lets work together to figure out the best way to have kids learn
math!

Here are my comments/thoughts -

Page 5 line 122; '...create equations to describe situations.' Can weave into
the framework the need to understand how creating an equation can lead to
creating a function and thus the difference between the two. Thanks!

Page 6 line 131 and 132; 'They compare and contrast linear and exponential
functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change.' Are you
referring to arithmetic and geometric sequences without using those terms? Why?
Are teachers bothered by them? Please be specific, although I realize this is a
framework and inherently general, I feel that arithmetic and geometric sequences
and subsequently, the idea of recursive and explicit forms are a pillar within
Mathematics I. Please refers to them explicitly (no pun intended) to help
emphasize their importance.

Page 6 line 139; '...assessing how a model fits data. They use regression
techniques to describe...' Can someone, somewhere, maybe not here in the
framework, please talk about the difference between a line of fit (done manually
using two points), a line of best fit (done electronically using a graphing
calculator like desmos) and the line of regression. Maybe a general statement
acknowledging that in mathematics we use multiple terms to describe the same
thing would suffice. Just a thought.

Page 6 lines 143 - 147; Due to the structure of the Integrated Pathway, and the
natural emphasis math teachers tend to put on algebra, I feel it is necessary to
make it 1000% clear that geometry must be an ESSENTIAL standard in Mathematics
1. Too often, I have seen geometry placed on the back burner or referred to as a
nice to know standard. The geometry is where the beauty and art in mathematics
comes alive. Teachers don't know how to teach it this way. We need materials
that take students from (order could vary) constructing a triangle, to
transforming a triangle in the coordinate plane, to using constructions and
transformations to prove triangles congruent. Teachers are not teaching it that
way. They are compartmentalizing these topics and it's a missed opportunity. No
one in public education taught it to me in this way, truly. We need to reeducate
our educators and get them to buy into the idea that this will have more meaning
to our students and therefore translate to deeper understanding and long term
retention. (It's lofty, but I've experienced it in micro moments in the
classroom.)

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"Dear Members of the Board of Education,

I am writing to express my concerns regarding certain educational frameworks
that have been implemented and their potential ramifications on the quality of
public education in our state. As a concerned citizen invested in the well-being
of our education system, I believe it is crucial to address these issues to
ensure the future success of our students.

Firstly, I would like to draw your attention to the concept of an 'anti-merit
statewide framework.' While I understand the importance of promoting equality in
education, it is essential to strike a balance between providing equal
opportunities and maintaining high academic standards. Lowering standards in the
name of equal outcomes could potentially compromise the quality of education our
students receive. I kindly request that the Board of Education carefully
considers the long-term effects of any policy changes and strives to find a
middle ground that promotes both equality and excellence in education.

Secondly, I would like to emphasize the increasing need for competent engineers,
scientists, mathematicians, and other STEM talents in our society. The
advancements and challenges of the modern world necessitate a strong focus on
STEM education. It is crucial that our public education system provides students
with the necessary skills and knowledge in these fields. Therefore, I urge the
Board of Education to prioritize and invest in quality STEM education, ensuring
that our students are well-prepared to tackle the demands of the future.

Lastly, I would like to express my reservations regarding an 'equity-themed math
framework.' While it is important to address systemic inequalities and foster
inclusive learning environments, it is equally essential to maintain a rigorous
and balanced approach to mathematics education. Incorporating diverse
perspectives and real-life applications in math can enhance students'
understanding and engagement. However, it is imperative to ensure that any
equity-focused frameworks do not compromise the development of fundamental
mathematical skills. I kindly request the Board of Education to approach these
frameworks with careful consideration and maintain a strong emphasis on
mathematical excellence while promoting equity objectives.

I believe that our education system plays a pivotal role in shaping the future
of our society. By addressing these concerns and finding a balance between
equality and excellence, we can provide our students with a high-quality
education that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities they will
face.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that the Board of Education
will give due attention to these concerns and take appropriate actions to ensure
the best possible educational outcomes for our students.

Sincerely,

Nirit Luchans

Ashit Patel,,ashit_patel@yahoo.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Support," Mathematics instruction in California can be more effective and
equitable. In many CA districts, current teaching practices have resulted in
only one-third of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures
across the state. Additionally, most students are being pushed out of high-level
pathways at a young age. Lessons are often based on routine tasks taught with
outdated methods, using narrow, procedural questions. This has had real
consequences. Today, less than half of California students satisfy A-G
requirements, thus limiting their choices and opportunities for college and
careers. California has insufficient educators qualified to work in STEM. It has
to hire thousands of people from other countries to address needs every year.

Math education has historically been a gatekeeper to college and career success,
preventing first-generation college-bound students, Black and Latine students,
students with disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to
4-year colleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers.

These programs are part of a legacy of inequitable educational programs which
use standardized tests and gifted programming to exclude Black students from
gifted classrooms and relegate English Learner students into low-level
educational pathways at an early age. These tests, often given in elementary
school, have been used to sort label students as those who are 'good at math'
and those who are not, and often determine who and who are not 'college
material.'

The revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics.

Students will be taught through rich, engaging problems highlighting
mathematical ideas and connections.
Pathways will be opened up so more students can learn algebra and take
higher-level math coursework.
A mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice. Students will
be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses
that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve.

Replacement of outdated tracking methods that segregated students into low-level
remedial classes - with acceleration and enrichment opportunities open to more
students.

Schools have been implementing the ideas in the framework for many years, based
on extensive scientific evidence, and have shown higher and more equitable
outcomes.

Decades of research and practice have demonstrated there are better models for
math instruction. Methods that are creative, inclusive, culturally responsive,
challenging, and affirming for all students and that engage students more
effectively. Strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to
make meaning, think critically, and progress at their own pace.

The revised framework was designed by a committee of 20 elected educators and
five writers and has gone through a two-year process of public comments and
revisions. As of April 2023, over 66 organizations and 2,800 educators,
researchers and parents signed a letter of support for the California Math

that largely to the high quality, high expectations math education I had access
to as a child in California. However, since 2012, the fraction of 13 year olds
taking algebra has declined from 34% to 24%. The proposed framework is a step
backwards, and poorly researched.
I‚Äôm pleased with some of the changes ‚Äì some culture war language was removed,
explicit support for San Francisco‚Äôs de-tracking experiments was removed and the
recommendations to de-track without acceleration were softened, following
debunking of the research that initially prompted them, and after the authors of
research that was misrepresented spoke out. However, the fixes are very ad hoc
and leave the framework inconsistent.
The language around tracking is especially incoherent. The framework favors
‚Äúgrouping‚Äù in which students are assigned to classes of their skill level, but
it‚Äôs not considered tracking as it‚Äôs not permanent. But authors seem to have
reservation about this, as the framework pushes to delay grouping as late as
possible ‚Äì see ‚ÄúProductive Strategies for Teaching Diverse Students‚Äù. This is
justified on the basis that ‚Äúengagement can fluctuate significantly during
adolescent years‚Äù; but that would suggest grouping should be delayed until
adulthood. Bizarrely, immediately after this remark, it suggests that high
achieving students should be able to ‚Äúto accelerate at any time‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt
distinguish that from grouping.
The framework also discourages tracking compared to pathways because tracking
locks in students to a certain set of courses in their future. Later, it
recommends that students be placed into ‚Äúpathways‚Äù, which are sets of courses
students plan to take in the future based on ability and interest.

The recommendations around this topic, simply put, are very confused.

Students are individuals who vary from one another, and any kind of one size

I have been a math teacher in SFUSD for several years now. This is what I've

grade without having their multiplication facts memorized, without the ability
to perform operations with positive and negative integers, decimals, and
fractions, without the ability to solve one-step, two-step, and muti-step
equations (even with integers!), and without the ability to work independently.
This has had a catastrophically negative effect on high school mathematics.

The achievement gap has dramatically grown and so has the bipolarity within our
classes. We‚Äôre now forced to differentiate our instruction over *multiple*
years; students who are entering 9th grade with less than a 5th grade level of

with Math that the US made for 40 years with reading ‚Äì choosing an ideological
approach with very weak evidence and ignoring a strong, evidence-based approach.
In that instance the state, like the rest of the US, went down the Whole
Language/Balanced Literacy path, rather than the strong, evidence-based Science
of Reading path.

It is pertinent to note in this context that while NY has apologized for its use
of Balanced Literacy and has committed to Science of Reading, CA persists in
using its failed methods to teach reading.

So I suppose one should not be surprised that CA, with some of the lowest math
achievement in the nation, now intends to make matters worse, with this dumbing
down of math standards, and the insertion of ‚Äúequity‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù
rather than math achievement, as its guiding star.

The framework makes claims that are blatantly false, such as ignoring research
on the importance of math fluency ie: memorization of key facts and procedures;
claiming that ‚Äúreaching fluency with multiplication and division within 100
represents a major portion of upper elementary grade students‚Äô work‚Äù whereas the
Common Core standards actually requires this fluency by third grade; claiming
that having students invent algorithms for basic operations is ‚Äúproductive
struggle‚Äù rather than a proven waste of time etc ad nauseum.

Brian Conrad, Stanford math professor, has analyzed the citations in the
framework, and shows that the findings of many studies are misrepresented.

An analysis of the citations ALSO shows that the actual best math ed practices
are NOT cited in the framework ‚Äì instead, ideological and weak evidence is given
priority.

‚ÄúThe What Works Clearinghouse, housed within the federal Institute of Education
Sciences, publishes practice guides for educators. The guides aim to provide
concise summaries of high-quality research on various topics. A panel of experts
conducts a search of the research literature and screens studies for quality,
following strict protocols. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies are
favored because of their ability to estimate causal effects. The panel
summarizes the results, linking each recommendation to supporting studies. The
practice guides present the best scientifically sound evidence on causal
relationships in teaching and learning.
How many of the studies cited in the practice guides are also cited in the
framework? To find out, I searched the framework for citations to the studies
cited by the four practice guides most relevant to K‚Äì12 math instruction. Here
are the results:


Assisting Students Struggling with Mathematics: Intervention in the Elementary
Grades
(2021) 0 out of 43 studies
Teaching Strategies for Improving Algebra Knowledge in Middle and High School
Students

Developing Effective Fractions Instruction for Kindergarten Through 8th Grade

In short, the Framework is an ideological document that will push CA students
even further down their already abysmal performance levels. Who will suffer?
Affluent parents and Asians of all income levels will move heaven and earth and
use outside resources to make sure their children learn math to the level
needed. They will learn math, untainted by ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù propaganda and
equity dumbing down.

It is the low income students this Framework so piously claims to want to help
who will be further crushed by it.

Norman Matloff,UC Davis,nsmatloff@ucdavis.edu,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve.",Oppose,"I believe the proposed Calif. Math Framework (CMF) would be HARMFUL
to students, especially HARMFUL TO BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN. I say this as (a)
a retired UC Davis professor who has taught math, statistics and computer
science, and (b) as a lifelong activist on behalf of URMs (underrepresented
minorities), starting with my work in 1968 on the congressional campaign of
Myrlie Evers, a historic Black figure, my term as Chair of the UCD faculty
Affirmative Action Committee, and so on. I make the following brief points:

1. The document is horribly biased, as seen in its failure to correct numerous
serious factual errors pointed out after the earlier version was released; the
failure to correct FACTUAL errors cannot be anything but deliberate. It has more
than 25 citations of the research of ONE single person, with NO references to
work by critics of the proposal. No critics were members of the advisory
committee. The main concession made by the revised document seems to be
mollifying parents who were worried their children would not be able to take
calculus; those of us with broader concerns about the curriculum as a whole were
ignored.

2. The negative impact on URM children, who are the most vulnerable in our
society, would be devastating.The courses in data science and the like would be
watered down to the point of uselessness (see below), and URMs would be shunted
into these classes, which would be dominated by URMs. The classes would be known
to the students as 'Black and Latino math,' a horribly stigmatizing situation.
This ideologically-based playing with URM lives is absolutely unconscionable.

3. I have long experience teaching statistics, and can say unequivocally that
the data science curricula would be useless. Yes, one can certainly teach data
science without calculus, but Algebra 2 is an indispensable prerequisite. Data
science is meaningless without a firm grasp of the concept of the slope of a
line. I've looked at the LAUSD version of a data science curriculum, and is both
superficial and riddled with conceptual errors. The UCLA lecturer who created
the curriculum has also made serious conceptual errors in a YouTube video on
college admissions.

4. That last ;point illustrates a more general principle: Data science is a
highly nuanced field, which is easy to misuse. Even if the curriculum were
revised to require Algebra 2, it would be quite difficult to obtain teachers
with the needed depth in DS; a short training course would not suffice.

I'm a Californian, born and raised, with a lifetime devotion to teaching. I have
even taught municipal ESL courses, and a brief supplementary math course for
5th-graders at a local elementary school. And I've been fortunate to have won
some teaching awards. I've thought long and hard about how young people learn
math, especially URMs, and it pains me to see California kids being treated this
way. Please do NOT approve this plan.

mathematics as it is practiced by those of us who actually do it for a living
that it is barely recognizable let alone a model for mathematics instruction.
First of all, math has nothing whatsoever do with fashionable Edu-speak
obsessions such as race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, etc. In
fact, several of the attributes of mathematics that make it so appealing to its
practitioners worldwide are that it is universal, deals with truths that cannot
be refuted, is undemocratic (does not depend on majority consensus for its
veracity), and excludes appeals to authority as grounds for the acceptance of
its conclusions. Another aspect of the framework that I find particularly
objectionable is the false assertion, permeating the framework, that math has to
be ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù to students‚Äô life experiences in order to be learned by them.
Nothing could be farther from the truth. The fact is, that if competently
taught, math is seen by most students to be an intrinsically fascinating subject
in its own right, no matter which side of the tracks they call home. And this
coming from me, a lifetime practitioner of applied, rather than pure,
mathematics.

California colleges of engineering are enrolling higher and higher proportions
of foreign students who do not suffer from the handicap imposed upon American
students by advocates of the concepts embodied in the proposed K-12 mathematics
framework because fewer and fewer California students are acquiring the
essential traditional math skills in K-12 necessary to handle twenty-first
century engineering curricula.

At greatest risk from the proposed framework are students from poor families,
because their parents cannot afford to send them to Kumon or the Russian School
of Mathematics ‚Äì private businesses that thrive on successfully providing
students with learning that compensates for the inadequacies of public school
mathematics instruction, a state of affairs that also contributes significantly
to the skewing of statistical studies of mathematics education outcomes in favor
of wealthier students.

California deserves better. I urge you to reject the proposed mathematics
framework.

Pramod Negi,,pramod11negi@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"The proposed math curriculum in the education system can have
several potential downsides:

1. Weakening foundational skills: The Proposed Math curriculum may result in a
diminished emphasis on foundational math skills. These skills are crucial for
advanced mathematical concepts and real-world applications. Weaker foundations
can hinder students' abilities to pursue careers in STEM fields and may limit
their overall mathematical competence.

2. Reduced problem-solving abilities: Rigorous math education fosters critical
thinking and problem-solving skills. By diluting the curriculum, students may
miss out on opportunities to develop their analytical and logical reasoning
abilities. This can have long-term consequences, as problem-solving skills are
essential in various academic disciplines and in everyday life.

3. Limited preparedness for higher education: A less rigorous math curriculum
may inadequately prepare students for the challenges they will encounter in
higher education. Many disciplines, including engineering, computer science,
economics, and physics, require strong mathematical foundations. Students may
struggle to succeed in these fields if they haven't received a rigorous math
education in their earlier years.

4. Impact on international competitiveness: This curriculum may negatively
impact a country's competitiveness on the global stage. In an increasingly
interconnected world, proficiency in mathematics is crucial for scientific
research, technological innovation, and economic growth. This framework will
impact out state of California and then USA will produce graduates who are less
equipped to compete internationally in these domains.

5. Disparity in education quality: The proposed math curriculum may exacerbate
existing disparities in education quality. Students from disadvantaged
backgrounds may be disproportionately affected, as they often rely on education
systems to provide them with opportunities to bridge the socio-economic gap.
Weaker math education can perpetuate inequality by limiting their access to
high-paying careers and advanced educational opportunities.

6. Teacher preparedness and professional development: Implementing this Math
curriculum may require significant changes in teaching methodologies,
instructional resources, and professional development for teachers. Adequate
training and support for educators are essential to ensure they can effectively
adapt their teaching strategies. Insufficient preparation can hinder teachers'

Re: Support for the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft for SBE Consideration

As a Middle School Mathematics teacher for 36 years and the President of the
California Math Council-North Section, I am urging the State Board of Education
to adopt the Revised Draft Mathematics Framework. It will create a foundation
for schools and districts to build upon as they strengthen their mathematics
programs to ensure success in math for all students, especially as we are
striving to support all learners to develop deep mathematical understanding and
accelerate learning post-pandemic

The Revised Draft Mathematics Framework supports a modernized mathematics
sequence which offers multiple pathways that provide mathematically rich and
rigorous options for students through:

*content that expands views about what mathematics is, how it is vital to their
lives, and why they should learn it,
*a pedagogy that provides access for all students to learn rigorous mathematics
regardless of race, gender, culture, religion, background, disability, or
learning needs, and
*a safe and inclusive learning environment that celebrates the diversity of
mathematics and mathematicians.

I believe our students deserve to have an organized delivery system of
mathematics education and I believe our teachers deserve training to support the
needs of all students. This Revised Draft Mathematics Framework provides
guidance to our mathematical education community in order to support our
administrators, coaches, teachers, and parents with the structure, pathways and
decision-making policies that our students need now.

Please adopt the Revised Draft Mathematics Framework so we can encourage,
inspire, and support all students to appreciate the beauty and importance of
mathematics in their lives.

Todd Kemp,UC San Diego,tkemp@ucsd.edu,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"The new high school Data Science pathway is deeply flawed. It is
intended as a route for students who are challenged by algebra to learn some
concepts related to real world data science in a less mathematically focused
way. In principle this may be a reasonable goal for some students, but the
actual curriculum here isn't much more than a repeat of data representation
ideas from earlier grades. It utterly fails to build the conceptual framework
for students to apply mathematical / quantitative reasoning to both abstract and
real world physical phenomena.

More directly: students who study this pathway instead of Algebra II /
Integrated Math III will be hopelessly behind their peers when they enter
colleges and universities in California or elsewhere. It is deeply ironic that
this curriculum is called 'Introduction to Data Science', when any students
entering any University of California campus from this pathway will have to take
AT LEAST TWO algebra / precalculus classes before other prerequisites for the
introductory Data Sciences courses! This will negatively impact time-to-degree
and college readiness for potentially thousands of students.

Most worrying: I fear that the California high schools with fewer resources will
be tempted to offer the Data Science pathway INSTEAD of Algebra II / Integrated
Math III. Students at such high schools are already seriously disadvantaged;
this policy will only serve to increase the inequality and disadvantage those
students now suffer.

Tom Loveless,None,tloveless54@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I write this letter to oppose the proposed California Math
Framework. My comments are a distillation of a lengthier analysis presented in
the Spring 2023 issue of Education Next, 'California's New Math Framework
Doesn't Add Up.'

The framework‚Äôs stated purpose is ‚Äúto support implementation of the California
Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM).‚Äù The framework
undermines the standards, in some cases directly contradicting them.

The framework states: ‚ÄúAttaining fluency with multiplication and division within
100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students‚Äô work.‚Äù How
can that be? If students know multiplication facts ‚Äúfrom memory‚Äù at the end of
third grade‚Äîas stipulated in the state standards--why would they still be
working on basic fact fluency in the upper elementary grades? But the claim is
repeated: ‚ÄúAcquiring fluency with multiplication facts begins in third grade and
development continues in grades four and five.‚Äù (pg. 83)

Note that California‚Äôs 2013 math framework contained almost the exact same
wording to describe third grade expectations. ‚ÄúMultiplication and division are
new concepts in grade three, and reaching fluency with these operations within
100 represents a major portion of students‚Äô work. By the end of grade three,
students also know all products of two one-digit numbers from memory (3.OA.7 ).‚Äù
A major portion of 3rd grade work will now become a major portion of the work in
upper elementary grades. What a step backwards!

What does fluent mean? The 2013 framework offers a clear definition, consistent
with other states that adopted Common Core. ‚ÄúThe word fluent is used in the
standards to mean ‚Äòreasonably fast and accurate‚Äô and possessing the ability to
use certain facts and procedures with enough facility that using such knowledge
does not slow down or derail the problem solver as he or she works on more
complex problems.‚Äù The new framework redefines fluency to discourage an emphasis
on speed.

The California Common Core Math Standards call for students to demonstrate an
understanding of, and the ability to use, the standard algorithms of addition
and subtraction by the end of fourth grade, multiplication by the end of fifth
grade, and division by the end of sixth grade. These are culminating standards,
not ironclad rules regarding when standard algorithms can and cannot be taught.

The proposed math framework interprets these standards as banning the teaching
of standard algorithms before the culminating grade, a false interpretation
explicitly debunked by Jason Zimba, one of the Common Core co-authors. If this
framework is adopted, California‚Äôs students will encounter the standard division
algorithm for the first time in sixth grade, years after most of the world has
attained mastery.

Please reject the proposed framework.

memorization along with equally important collaborative and critical thinking
strategies. I grew up learning Algebra in 8th Grade in the late 90's in
California and this has served me well throughout my non-mathematical career to
apply critical thinking to my daily life and situations. There's no reason in
the framework, as far as I can tell, that this hybrid approach from the 90's
isn't accessible to all students from all walks of life.
Please reconsider approving this new framework.

As a parent of SFUSD, which has denied middle school students the opportunity to
take algebra and as a result, has seen abysmal performance in math proficiency
and enacted gross, unnecessary roadblocks for students interested in STEM
education by forcing kids to take summer school or double up on math in one
year, it is a fools errand to impose this non-sensical framework onto the ENTIRE
STATE. If the goal is to find a path to retain motivated children and their
families in CA public schools, then DO NOT ADOPT THIS FRAMEWORK. Families and
kids who want their kids to pursue careers in STEM would leave the public
schools in droves. And as a result, the public school system will be more
decimated. You want to turn the tide on enrollment? Offer more rigor, not less,
make more schools like magnate schools instead of watering down the most
fundament discipline in STEM education. MATH.

Finally, Jo Boaler is a grifter who charges poor schools in Ventura $5,000 an
hour. By adopting this, your legitimizing her grift and the public school system
and the kids in the public schools in California will suffer as a result. DO NOT

Super Bowl Indicator is neither believable nor accurate, the correlation between
students‚Äô racial makeup and math performance can not be used to argue that race
is a factor in students‚Äô math or academic performance. If we gather enough data,
we may find a strong positive correlation between math performance and religion,

sport or hobby. But it would be unwise for us to try to achieve equity in
religion, hair color, sports or hobby. Rather, students‚Äô performance is the
result of numerous factors, including family dynamic, family value and attitude
about education, students‚Äô personal motivation, students‚Äô academic abilities,
student‚Äôs time living in the US, students‚Äô study habits and sturdy time,

flawed document through under cover of darkness, given it impacts millions of
children.

I would like to comment on just a few of the proposed CMF‚Äôs errors:

1) Rampant citation misrepresentation: Many of the documents‚Äô assertions are
quite simply hard to believe. They were justified via citations to other papers.
In essentially all cases, the papers were seriously misrepresented in the CMF.
Some even had conclusions opposite to what was said in the CMF. The solution is
to remove all references to non-academic research, since those papers have NO
standards and are not good references for a math framework that is going to
affect millions of children. The next step is to replace all references that are
not peer reviewed academic papers with references to actual research. Can‚Äôt find
any? Well you have your answer!

2) Gross conflict of interest: CMF author(s) stand to profit from
recommendations made in the document (eg, selling recommended curriculum). This
presents a significant conflict of interest. Probably, it is illegal.

3) Misrepresentation of data science field: The authors conflate statistics and
data science; they are not the same. Also, data science undergraduate degrees
require calculus, and data science jobs at Spotify, Salesforce, Amazon, Dropbox,
Google, LinkedIn, etc. require degrees in fields such as math, economics,
engineering, computer science, etc., and these require calculus and linear
algebra. Overall, the field and its prerequisites are grossly misrepresented.

Worse, The CMF writing team has ignored the explicit warnings by SBE member
Patricia Rucker that bias towards data science over other math routes is
forbidden.

4) Activism and jargon vs substance: The document contains lengthy passages

days to review and comment on the revised draft of this framework, a period
containing a Tuesday federal holiday, no less. There was no advance notice or
updates to the Schedule of Significant Events provided (no changes made to that
page since July of 2022), and a 1006 page document simply appeared on the
website in late June. This is particularly egregious in light of the multitude
of problems found in the prior draft.

The second field review exposed many issues in that draft, including those of
misrepresented citations, misconceptions about the math skills required for
contemporary college degrees, both in STEM and STEM-adjacent fields, a
mathematically anemic Data Science pathway that had no business being part of
this framework in the first place, and faulty opinion-based recommendations
related to high-school pathways, acceleration, equity, technology, assessment,
and placement. These issues are on record in the SFR public comments from Brian
Conrad, Maya Keshavan, Edith Cohen, Jelani Nelson, and others.

In my preliminary reading of this 2023 draft, I've found the same statements of
opinion, many of them reworded to sound slightly less objectionably mistaken,
and often with no evidence cited whatsoever. Misrepresented citations still
appear, even though Brian Conrad had pointed them out in painstaking detail, and
the CMF assertions for those that were removed still remain in the revised
document.

Chapter 8 illustrates 'pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common
ninth- and tenth-grade experience,' and this experience puts Algebra 1 squarely
in 9th grade (not 8th), even though the Superintendent of San Francisco Unified
School District has announced that this plan has failed after 10 years of shoddy
proficiency performance, and families are clamoring to have the district bring
back Algebra in 8th grade.

The cited evidence being used to support nearly all of the bold assertions and
change guidance in this framework are rarely from appropriate sources, and when
they are, they represent a one-sided take from the existing body of evidence. I
will follow up with another comment, covering this issue in more detail.

appropriate references. Claims that have been removed from prior drafts include:

(i) The repeat rate in San Francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to
9th grade fell from 40% to 8%, and
(ii) Most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math

Problems with references continue with this draft. My recommendation is that all
references that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either
removed or replaced with proper references. If they cannot be replaced, the
items in the CMF that depend on the non-academic references need to be removed,
too. I'll provide two examples of non-academic references below that should be
removed, but these are just two examples to make the point clear. All of the
non-academic references need to be examined carefully by the California
Department of Education.

For example, the Boaler, Munson, and Williams reference from Youcubed - What is
Mathematical Beauty - is not academic research and ends with an advertisement
for books written by the authors. As Boaler is also an author of the CMF, having
a reference advertising her books included in the CMF is inappropriate.

A second example is the Boaler and Foster paper on Youcubed - Raising
Expectations and Achievement. Again, this is not academic research. The paper
has a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the CMF as political. It
is inappropriate to have a reference in the CMF criticizing opposition to the
CMF. This paper also discusses a study - referred to as 'study 2' in the paper -
that compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015. This
comparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student
achievement from a score difference on an Algebra II test one year and an 8th
grade math test in the next year. This reference to the study in this paper in
Chapter 9 of the CMF goes even farther to state (without reference or
explanation) that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling.

The claims about 'study 2' in chapter 9 of the CMF are an example of important
claims in the CMF (in this case, tracking) that are not backed by published
academic research. Again, this reference - and all non-academic research cited
in the CMF - needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic
research. As this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015, there
has been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores. If the only
discussion of these exam scores is the post on Youcubed, this reference and the
discussion about tracking supported by it, needs to be removed.

There are millions of students in California whose lives will be affected by the
CMF It is the responsibility of the California Department of Education to ensure
that the ideas in the document are supported properly. Non academic work like
blog posts, books, or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as
academic work. The inclusion of advertisements and political statements about
opposition are obviously not appropriate references. Non-academic studies cannot
be central to the CMF's proposal either.

A new framework was adopted in 2013 which replaced California's 'Algebra for all
in 8th grade' policy. A lot of misinformation was disseminated to say that
California students were not doing well in Algebra 1 by using 'repeat rates'
instead of failure.

A circus shell game if ever there was one. Students had to pass the Algebra 1
CST (old STAR system) and receive a C in order to be promoted to Geometry. The
Ed Code changed in 2016 *and* the math placement act also was enacted to stop
forcing students to repeat classes based on test scores if they had already
passed the class. It is nonsense to use data pre 2013 as a comparison to post
common core.

However? We do have an on going experiment in San Francisco based on Dr.
Boaler's recommendations, many which are in this framework. And in fact this
framework reads like an informercial for Youcubed, her Stanford 'non profit'.

San Francisco did not track previously, everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 8th
grade. In 2014 everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 9th grade. There was no
improvement in grades. What did happen is the underserved communities lost
access to higher math Precalculus enrollment did not increase. SFUSD lied about
their compression class, calling it Algebra 2 + Precalculus but UC a-g rejects
it as a precalculus class and gives Algebra 2 credit. This under preparation
harms students.

Diversifying STEM is extremely important. This framework does not accomplish
this goal. It will increase opportunity gaps as the resourced supplement.

The 'Sold a Story' podcast (literacy) should be required listening because we're
about to do the same thing in math.

why we cannot implement the same here ‚Äì because it works.

The framework is heavy on critical theory and political buzzwords, light on
actual math. It reads like an instructional manual on social justice ‚Äì not how
to teach math.

The main focus is equity ‚Äì for which there are no measurable objective
benchmarks. In fact, I did not find anything in the framework regarding how to
measure success. If anyone else found that part, please tell me.

The framework defines equity as: ‚ÄúEquity. Equity refers to fairness in education
rather than sameness. Drawing from Gutierrez (2012), equity includes four
dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access to tangible resources; (2)
Participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them; (3) Student
identity development in mathematics; and (4) Attention to relations of power.‚Äù
Do we really need to be focused on student identity development in math, or
attention to relations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is
objectively insane to me.

From the overview: ‚ÄúThe goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning
so that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better
understand and positively impact the world‚Äîin their careers, in college, and in
civic life.‚Äù
From chapter 1: ‚ÄúReflecting the state‚Äôs commitment to equity, every chapter in
this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help
mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.‚Äù
Equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2,
9 and 10.

It‚Äôs also focused on ‚Äúenvironmental literacy‚Äù ‚Äì which has nothing to do with
learning math.

think anything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the
office of superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. It is not surprising
that they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas.

new framework based on those that have proven successful ‚Äì like those in

Chapter 9: Structuring School Experiences for Equity and Engagement - 'slow' vs.

start out slow, and through practice, we are able to ride 'fast' without even
thinking about the riding process. Students can learn to be 'fast' in basic
math. When facing a complex problem, 'slow' is definitely the best approach. The
discussion in Chapter 9 does not address the need for students to become 'fast'
for basic math such as multiplication. I volunteered as a tutor in a
continuation program. The students needed calculators to figure out what is 8X7.

George Barton,,geobarton@sbcglobal.net,Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework,Oppose,"Dear California State Board of Education,

I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)
proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students
with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as
Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success
into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear
pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the
K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to
accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the
CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek
math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system,
leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged
peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade
level with limited options to better their situation through STEM.

The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in
their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade
11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and
in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of
these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second
version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in
at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress
has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR
Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the
current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate
until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of
lowering overall math course taking for high school students.

The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade
level peers until grade 11
The CMF describes ‚Äúheterogeneously grouped classrooms‚Äù from ‚Äúgrade school
through high school‚Äù (Ch 1, line 208).
The CMF notes ‚Äúpossible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common
ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh
and twelfth grade.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295).

Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, ‚ÄúThe framework recommends that all students
take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight.‚Äù It
is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about
acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10
and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was
evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11,
but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9.
This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a
CMF that the SBE adopts
As ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the
CMF states, ‚ÄúAnother review of international evidence about tracking found that,
while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or
tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier
increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009).‚Äù (Ch 9, Line
148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far
outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the
CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this
quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from
acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT
SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same
school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a
different school while their peers are left at a ‚Äúlower‚Äù school than there are
with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced
math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but
then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary
arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize,
often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other
aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math
Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration
based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of
what it means to ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù.
What does non-acceleration look like?
Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11,
the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, ‚ÄúWhen
differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of
advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students
to reach advanced courses like calculus.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students,
1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to
students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below
grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th
graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of
students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach?
If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer
and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also
suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that
explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line
327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each
student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations,
and students able to complete ‚Äúcourses‚Äù anytime during the year and progress to
the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in
one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the
math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly
more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an
explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some
over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and
affects college admission, etc.
In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School ‚Äúis a time when students
make choices about mathematics coursework‚Äîor have those choices made for
them‚Äîthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career
achievements.‚Äù (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a
common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn‚Äôt the CMF making
choices for students that have ‚Äúlong term implications‚Äù, such as their not being
competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as
their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)?
This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give
CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High
School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready.

Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this
proposal.
The CMF states, ‚ÄúThese perceptions may also be linked to labels‚Äî ‚Äúlow kids,‚Äù
‚Äúbubble kids,‚Äù ‚Äúslow kids‚Äù ‚Äîthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics
education for students, with some channeled into low level math.‚Äù (Ch 1 line
243). First, since when is ‚Äúdifferentiated math‚Äù a bad thing? The CMF has stated
how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://e.g.Ch__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!doJIn0oSXS3nuOnlC4H_lVgbYdCtnvx2XONJsFTWS4nxv4RQiNHu4FzV1HcI1fLOdfbeHtMWOo9GKDr-QoKDh3Q_$]
8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a ‚Äúlow level‚Äù math
class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California
Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing
(SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are
hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated
Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man.
‚ÄúResearch indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all
students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was
undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements,
widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics
achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth
grade failed to score ‚Äúproficient‚Äù on the end-of-course Algebra California
Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the
Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average
than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth
grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012).‚Äù (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate
statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to
accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in
by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a ‚Äúhit‚Äù on their API score
was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no
one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues
for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What
about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period
described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive
about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all
students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In
addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all
students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how can the SBE
adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and
propose large scale changes based upon these false claims?
Chapter 9 line 120 reads, ‚ÄúFor many, this tracking begins in the early years of
elementary school‚Äîoften around third grade.‚Äù There is no citation here and NO
evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow
acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very
few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that ‚Äúfor many‚Äù
acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in
grade 3 (or even 4 or 5).

The ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust
and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students
The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra
II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. ‚ÄúAn alternative
to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum
instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that
students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends
to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus
repeats content from Algebra II.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter
8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they
should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be
addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual
understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts.

While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I,
Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school,
it also argues that students who don‚Äôt accelerate in middle school are ‚Äústuck‚Äù.
Chapter 9 line 121 reads, ‚ÄúSchools sometimes use elementary school test data to
determine students‚Äô placement, which typically also determines their ultimate
destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often
cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable.‚Äù I agree
wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a
STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is
another logical fallacy. Why can‚Äôt some students accelerate in middle school (if
they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed
above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for
students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway
throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options
(for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San
Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the
opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in
middle school!
The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. ‚ÄúSchools may
also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students
who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in
high school if they choose.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to
summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically
disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings
during the summer.
The CMF proposes ‚Äúdoubling up‚Äù to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8
line 819 we read, ‚ÄúSo, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school‚Äôs
precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers
for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school
time.‚Äù Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might
help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the
CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11?
The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. ‚ÄúOne form of flexible grouping
involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later grades‚Äîe.g.,
from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth grade‚Äîand supporting extra
course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that
students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school.‚Äù (Ch 8 line
226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra
burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra
time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the
public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will
be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate
and reach Calculus.

The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers
expectations, and as such, will harm CA students
The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take
Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is
lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students
to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees
and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, ‚ÄúIn addition to offering Mathematics III
or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and
fourth-year courses.‚Äù The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11,
and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not
take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than
providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the
CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that
‚ÄúIf students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra
II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for
taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is
expected in some universities for STEM majors).‚Äù (Ch 8 line 758)
The CMF points out that ‚Äúto meet the law‚Äù students really only need Algebra I.
Chapter 8 line 677 states, ‚ÄúBy completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics
I and II,[1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill
220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two
mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high
school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I.‚Äù The SBE and
California should not be okay with the CMF‚Äôs attitude of ‚Äúlowering the bar‚Äù.
Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the
CMF‚Äôs proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which
California has made great strides.

The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate
beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined
students.
In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually
points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math
students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a
class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877
we read, ‚ÄúThe UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a
similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding
of the mathematical concepts taught at each K‚Äì12 grade level. A strong grasp of
these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students
should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an
individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into
advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed,
students whose math classes are at a mismatched level‚Äîeither too advanced or too
basic‚Äîoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)‚Äù

Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced
from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration
before grade 11) to an attitude of It‚Äôs possible, but not desired, to accelerate
in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear
pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any
mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to ‚Äúguide‚Äù with
their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third
version) notes that more discussion is needed: ‚ÄúIt would be helpful for the
state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify
possible high school pathways.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 245)

Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of
math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù
should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry
points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways
throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students
need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should
be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having
to ‚Äúdouble up‚Äù and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice
they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before
grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds
accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with
‚Äútracking‚Äù in other countries in which students join entirely different,
homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers
need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private
schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected.

Changing the framework should be done in a way that is easily and transparently
compatible with the current CA-CCSS-M content standard, or it should be done in
coordination with a revision of those standards. The 2022 and 2023 CMF drafts do
neither, and thus we have a much improved but still controversial 900+ page
document that creates an awkward and cumbersome framework consisting of 'drivers
for investigation,' 'content connections,' the CA-CCSS-M mathematical practice,
and 'big ideas.' However, the interaction of the big ideas and the other
components (DI's, CC's, MP's) is unclear. Moreover, the big ideas seem to
replace the CA-CCSS-M (at least on the student facing side) which may be an okay
idea if on the teacher side the connections are clear. Unfortunately, the 900
pages of the framework fail to make those connections in the crucial and
controversial area of Algebra 2 and Integrate 3. This sows distrust and concern.

By comparison one could look at Illustrative Mathematics which works within the
structures of the common core while also building in progressions across grade
levels, contextualization with an eye to broaden engagement, and attention to
professional development.

The committee would do well to read the article summarizing a forum that the AMS
Committee on Education hosted in June last year where these issues were
discussed cordially and professionally:

Edith Cohen,,edco.edco@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I am writing to express my concerns with the revised draft (v3) of
the CA Mathematics Framework. I am also a California resident and a parent that
cares deeply about education. I am a Computer Scientist, I teach college courses
in data science and computer science and I have a solid understanding of the
foundations needed for success in college-level STEM. I am also an experienced
researcher and understand how to use data, evidence, and citations. I am very
concerned with this draft.

The revised version corrected some of the issues in v2. In particular, the MIC
pathway (that was ill defined and should have never been there) was removed. But
many glaring issues remain and few new ones were added. Most importantly, the
document is very far from being useful and seems ideology-driven rather than
evidence and research-based. It does not follow basic standards of scholarship.

The stakeholders (students, parents, school districts, colleges, industry)
expect and deserve a guidance document that is done professionally, that
includes a careful synthesis of the education literature, and a review of best
practices that work. The draft is a mockery of scholarship. Statements are being
written with citations that frequently do not support the statements. Other
citations are not to scholarly documents but to opinion pieces that make
non-verifiable and sometimes egregious claims. At other occasions there is solid
research that supports the opposite recommendation that is just being completely
ignored. This is unacceptable.

Another issue is the conflict-ridden UC area-C loophole, where courses that have
very little math content were approved as ‚Äúadvanced math courses‚Äù that validate
Algebra 2. The CMF earlier drafts were part of a mass campaign that deceived CA
students and families with regard to the preparation needed for college-level
STEM. The current v3 draft retracted some of this hype (removed the
falsely-represented MIC pathway), but some of the hype remains. It is rather
astonishing and unacceptable that the v3 draft still alludes to the faulty
approval of these courses (a careless mistake at best) as a way to promote false
ideas.

The v3 draft made cosmetic and wording changes and still ignored many of the
issues that were previously pointed out painstakingly by Brian Conrad and
others. At this point it seems clear that the issues can not be simply fixed by
addressing specific comments. Careful review and addressing in a sincere way all
comments by Professor Brian Conrad, Mike Lawler and Tom Loveless will only get
us part of the way. To create a helpful document, a new writing team needs to
write the document from scratch.

Finally, the time given to the public to review the 1000 pages draft, with so
little warning, is insufficient. Especially for a document that is so far from
being acceptable.

I hope you will take responsibility for our students and all stakeholders and
reject the current draft.

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",N/A,"RE: CA Math Framework changes:

1. CA should be using 2023 reality and awareness and NOT guidelines emerging
from 2019. Everything has changed since 2019. CA needs to go back to the drawing
board ASAP. ‚ÄúThe guidelines are based on statutory requirements, feedback from
focus group meetings in August of 2019, student focus groups in September and
October 2019, information provided by the Instructional Quality Commission and
the State Board of Education, and public comment.‚Äù
2. Although this is a laudable goal it has NOTHING to do with teaching math.
‚ÄúThe CFCC shall include ample concepts and strategies throughout the grade-level
chapters to support universal access and ensure access, equity, and inclusion
for all students.‚Äú
3. NAEP math scores have plunged in CA. CA fails to include discussion of
bringing up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the NAEP
proves.
4. The insertion of equity discussion does not belong in Math class but rather
in social sciences.
5. There is NO provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math
class as a discussion class on equity.
6. UDL contractual agreement to teach math is not going to raise math scores or
math competency.
7. NAEP scores lowest in a decade. Where is the math proficiency component in
the math framework.
8. More significantly, perhaps, the amount of 13-year-olds deemed proficient or
better in math went from 34 percent in 2019 to just 26 percent today.
9. In math scores went from terrible to worse: 41 percent proficient in 2019, to
just 36 percent proficient in 2022
10. The NAEP reading proficiency was also stunningly low: 37 percent in 2019,
down from 40 percent in 1998.
11. Students will continue to fail if CA refuses to address actual proficiency
in math and reading. CA fails to provide the plan for students who are failing
and provide for those students who are able to proficient and able to take
advanced classes.

Alexandra Morris,New Classrooms,amorris@newclassrooms.org,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Neutral,"Dear California State Board of Education:

I wanted to draw your attention to a technical error in the third edition of the
Mathematics Framework that should be changed before vote and publication.

Chapter 9: Structuring School Experiences for Equity and Engagement includes a
section on Personalized Learning beginning on page 13. Within this section,
which we are strongly supportive of, there is an example of our innovative
learning model which begins on page 15 starting with line 376 and continuing to
line 378. It reads:

‚Äù376 A study of this model found that participating students improved at a
faster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than did a nationally
representative comparison group (Margolis, 2019).‚Äù

However, this study (Margolis, 2019) of our Teach to One model has been
incorrectly attributed in to another example of a teacher-developed approach
from Modern Classroom which starts on line 372:

‚Äú372 In one successful teacher-developed approach, students engage in blended,
self-paced, mastery-based learning with teacher-made videos supplementing
in-class problem-solving individually and in collaborative groups, with
continual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and
competence (Modern Classroom, 2021). A study of this model found that
participating students improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics
assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis,
2019).‚Äù

It should instead read (as it did in draft two) :

‚Äú372 In one successful teacher-developed approach, students engage in blended,
self-paced, mastery-based learning with teacher-made videos supplementing
in-class problem-solving individually and in collaborative groups, with
continual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and
competence (Modern Classroom, 2021). A similar model developed by a middle
school teacher and now taught in many schools, uses diagnostic assessments to
create a tailored set of assignments for each student that the teacher can use
in technology-infused mix of direct instruction, collaborative work with peers,
and individualized learning. A study of this model found that participating
students improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than
did a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis, 2019).‚Äù

put into the education of our future generations.
But proposed math teaching methodologies are diametrically opposed to the real
world where what you want is the right answer - quickly.

Making answers in sentences is simply making long responses (Kindergarten-Grade
two: Example problem #3) and is not real world where 36 plus 25 has 25 on top of
36 and you add: 5+6=11, write 1 and carry one over to the 3+2 column and 3+2 =5
+ the 1 carried over = 61! That's real world - the one these kids will find in
their employers 'Standard Operating Practices' manual. Not some circles equaling
10s.

So parents who want their kids to learn math will adopt the methods of China and
States who exceed in testing - call it repetitive learning! Not what you will

and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead
to greater
inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all
of their education
outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but
socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who
are often 3-5
years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through
STEM.
The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in
their
statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11.
There was NO
mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies
with false or
misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the
SBE did not
pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third,
version now has
some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an
option. While
progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that
CLEAR Pathways
be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current
CMF is still
very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as
well as keeping
with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking
for high school
students.
The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade
level
peers until grade 11
‚óè The CMF describes ‚Äúheterogeneously grouped classrooms‚Äù from ‚Äúgrade school
through
high school‚Äù (Ch 1, line 208).
‚óè The CMF notes ‚Äúpossible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a
common
ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh
and twelfth
grade.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295).
Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, ‚ÄúThe framework recommends that all students
take the
same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight.‚Äù It is
obvious that there
are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course
taking as two
places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently
some folks
working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want
no acceleration
before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration
before grade
9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in
a CMF that the
SBE adopts

1

‚óè As ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11,
the CMF
states, ‚ÄúAnother review of international evidence about tracking found that,
while most
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not
differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those
that track
students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning
significantly
(Woessmann, 2009).‚Äù (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other
countries
(who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10,
and yet
the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in
this
quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from
acceleration
(Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not
being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There
are very
different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while
their peers
are left at a ‚Äúlower‚Äù school than there are with the current policy in
California where a
student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another
might
be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one
student
taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics.
Students
recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students
and
other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math
Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration
based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of
what it
means to ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù.
What does non-acceleration look like?
‚óè Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade
11, the
CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, ‚ÄúWhen
differentiation
occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced
students, the
curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced
courses
like calculus.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade
level
standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and
also
with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based
upon the
fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in
2021-22)
(link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher
really
going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced
students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest
students
also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that
explains
how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327),
but that
relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses
at
their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to
complete
‚Äúcourses‚Äù anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student
might
complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student
completed
just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for,
then there
needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it
with
evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking
courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on
transcripts
and affects college admission, etc.

2

‚óè In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School ‚Äúis a time when students
make
choices about mathematics coursework‚Äîor have those choices made for them‚Äîthat
have long-term implications, including for their college and career
achievements.‚Äù (Ch 7
line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience
until
grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn‚Äôt the CMF making choices for students that
have ‚Äúlong
term implications‚Äù, such as their not being competitive for college admission
into STEM
majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private
schools did
accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that
is
adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle
School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to
accelerate when ready.
Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this
proposal.
‚óè The CMF states, ‚ÄúThese perceptions may also be linked to labels‚Äî ‚Äúlow kids,‚Äù
‚Äúbubble
kids,‚Äù ‚Äúslow kids‚Äù ‚Äîthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics
education for
students, with some channeled into low level math.‚Äù (Ch 1 line 243). First,
since when is
‚Äúdifferentiated math‚Äù a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a
teacher
to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://e.g.Ch__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!aPzV0y-pI8Klrs7S5hTSgZhNUXY4Zs8bp6Py-sFAOYNOpxzVy8lZumpdc-CN3Mi4CSecVWX2F464wZLsoJY$]
8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in
California has a ‚Äúlow level‚Äù math class (unless it is for SPED students). In
California,
thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and
standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through
high
school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra
I or
Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man.
‚óè ‚ÄúResearch indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all
students to
take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several
studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread
acceleration
often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that
most
students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score ‚Äúproficient‚Äù on
the
end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed
eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their
ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST
for
the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012).‚Äù (Ch
8 Line
269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students
should be
required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts
engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a ‚Äúhit‚Äù on their
API score
was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no
one should
accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are
the only
options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are
ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many
high
performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take
Algebra I in
grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the
test that
year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF
describes a
program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So,
how

3

can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF
does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims?
‚óè Chapter 9 line 120 reads, ‚ÄúFor many, this tracking begins in the early years
of
elementary school‚Äîoften around third grade.‚Äù There is no citation here and NO
evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow
acceleration in high
school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing
acceleration in grade
6. It is just not the case that ‚Äúfor many‚Äù acceleration (meaning taking a course
above
your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5).
The ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust
and will
harm socio-economically disadvantaged students
‚óè The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either
Algebra II or
Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. ‚ÄúAn alternative to
eighth grade
acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating
redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need
four
courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant
amount of
the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II.‚Äù (Ch
8 line
688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the
CMF is
proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which
standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to
develop
conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world
contexts.
While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I,
Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school,
it also
argues that students who don‚Äôt accelerate in middle school are ‚Äústuck‚Äù. Chapter
9 line
121 reads, ‚ÄúSchools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine
students‚Äô
placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because
students
are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways.
This
practice is unjustifiable.‚Äù I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to
determine if a
student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school;
however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can‚Äôt some students accelerate in
middle
school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as
proposed
above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for
students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway
throughout
middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for
example
Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino
County). If
we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM
careers,
we need flexible pathways starting in middle school!
‚óè The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. ‚ÄúSchools may
also
organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who
start
Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high
school if they
choose.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to
accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged
students
who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer.

4

‚óè The CMF proposes ‚Äúdoubling up‚Äù to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8
line 819
we read, ‚ÄúSo, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school‚Äôs precalculus class,
along with
a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in
mathematics grows late in their high school time.‚Äù Why does a student need to
forgo an
elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career
to take
another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same
class
until grade 11?
‚óè The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. ‚ÄúOne form of flexible
grouping
involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later grades‚Äîe.g.,
from
fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth grade‚Äîand supporting extra
course-taking
options during the school year or during summer school so that students may
accelerate
at any time during middle or high school.‚Äù (Ch 8 line 226) The public school
system
needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take
extra
classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as
students
with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs
met and
their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or
without the
opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus.
The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers
expectations, and
as such, will harm CA students
‚óè The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take
Algebra
II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering
expectations
rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra
II, thus
keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730
reads,
‚ÄúIn addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the
flexibility to offer
other third-year and fourth-year courses.‚Äù The SBAC only assesses high school
students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II.
If
students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high
percentages. Rather
than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards,
the CMF
proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that ‚ÄúIf
students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II),
they
should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus
in
high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some
universities for
STEM majors).‚Äù (Ch 8 line 758)
‚óè The CMF points out that ‚Äúto meet the law‚Äù students really only need Algebra I.
Chapter 8
line 677 states, ‚ÄúBy completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II,
[1]
students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the
2015
legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses
in order
to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course
meeting the
rigor of Algebra I.‚Äù The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF‚Äôs
attitude of
‚Äúlowering the bar‚Äù. Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra
II; to enact
the CMF‚Äôs proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which
California has made great strides.

5

The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate
beginning in middle
school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students.
‚óè In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually
points out
a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students
tend
to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with
students
with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, ‚ÄúThe UC
Board of
Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS
commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical
concepts taught at each K‚Äì12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is
crucial for
college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough
time to
master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far
more
important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying
conceptual
knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched level‚Äîeither
too
advanced or too basic‚Äîoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic.
(BOARS,
2016)‚Äù
Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced
from the
changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before
grade 11) to an
attitude of It‚Äôs possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I
ask the SBE to reject
this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can
be explained
(or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position
to ‚Äúguide‚Äù with
their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third
version) notes that more
discussion is needed: ‚ÄúIt would be helpful for the state to convene a working
group of
mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways.‚Äù (Ch 8
line 245)
Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of
math (including
Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù should be clearly
mapped out in a
CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students
to get on or
off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become
larger
issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math).
These pathways
should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without
having to
‚Äúdouble up‚Äù and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice
they give districts;
the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the
CMF states
not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class
within a
heterogeneous high school with ‚Äútracking‚Äù in other countries in which students
join entirely
different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or
careers
need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private
schools. This
CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected.",SBECOMMENT-20230706-145922,7/6/2023 2:59 PM,,,,

Christie Pesicka ,United Parents of LA,crowmutt@hotmail.com,Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework,Oppose,"Dear California State Board of Education,
I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)
proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California
Common Core Content Standards are being replaced with ‚ÄúBig Ideas‚Äù aligned to 4
‚ÄúContent Connections‚Äù which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor
written by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the ‚Äúbig
ideas‚Äù will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to
require that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards
adopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students
(especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based
instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards
ill-defined and vague ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù which have no guarantee of ensuring topics
required for success in math are mastered.
A California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: ‚ÄúThis framework
serves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for
Mathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013.‚Äù
(Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA
math content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly
FAILED to do its job.
In direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you
to reject recommends teaching ‚ÄúBig Ideas‚Äù as the content (see evidence below).
Who decided the ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù should replace the content standards (which were
created primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD‚Äôs in MATHEMATICS and which
were vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)?
According to the CMF, three individuals determined the ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù for
California and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468
we read, ‚ÄúThree big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and ‚ÄúThree big
ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high
school level call for students to do the following.‚Äù Who are ‚ÄúBoaler, Munson and
Williams‚Äù who apparently have the authority to determine what students in
California will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in
mathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor‚Äôs in Applied Mathematics). NONE of
the three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in
mathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù created by
non-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and
vetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce;
the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with
advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers.
Additionally, the CMF tells us these ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù (chosen by three individuals
without a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of
big ideas. ‚ÄúIt should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas
in mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation.
Providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with
colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their
grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks
that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas.‚Äù (Ch 7 line

Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is
implemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known
that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic
success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or
Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or
African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in
2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down
to 21% proficient or advanced in
2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54). The CMF provides, at
best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math
classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for
students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and
implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial
means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the
public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but
socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who
are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to make progress in
Math.

Furthermore, it is disheartening to have California consider a framework that
holds back students who are talented in mathematics and are ready to take
Calculus in high school. It is inconceivable to imagine a similar framework
proposed for young students who are talented in soccer, that will never happen
because young students who are talented in soccer need to join teams that can
further their talent. Same thing applies to Mathematics. Why is California
proposing a framework that will hurt our most talented Mathematicians?

Stephanie Holloway,Lake Elsinore Unified School District,stephanie.holloway@leusd.k12.ca.us,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Support,"Dear Members of the State Board of Education,

I am writing to express my strong support for the adoption of the new California
Mathematics Framework, particularly with regards to its impact on elementary
students and equity. I was part of the California Mathematics CFCC and am proud
of the work that we created as a team as we kept equity at the front of center
of our work. I sought to become part of the CFCC to provide clarity in the
framework guided by the principles of equity to create better mathematical
structures and outcomes for our students.

As an elementary math coach, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by
teachers in changing the math experience of students in their classrooms. The
proposed changes provide comprehensive solutions to address these challenges and
empower educators to create an equitable and meaningful learning environment for
all students.

Chapter 1 lays a solid foundation by emphasizing the importance of mathematical
coherence and the sequential development of mathematical concepts. This chapter
provides clarity and guidance to teachers, enabling them to align their
instruction with the progression of mathematical ideas. As a math coach, this
framework will serve as a valuable resource for me in supporting teachers as
they navigate the intricacies of building a coherent and robust mathematics
curriculum.

Chapter 2 focuses on mathematical practices, which are essential for developing
students' mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. By explicitly
highlighting these practices, the new framework provides teachers with a
framework for fostering critical thinking, communication, and collaboration
skills among their students. As a math coach, I can utilize the framework to
help teachers incorporate these practices into their instruction, thereby
empowering students to become confident mathematical thinkers.

Chapter 3 addresses the critical need for differentiated instruction to cater to
the diverse needs of students. It provides strategies and resources to help
teachers meet students where they are and support their individual growth. The
framework acknowledges that students come from varied backgrounds and possess
differing levels of prior knowledge. As a math coach, this chapter equips me
with practical tools to guide teachers in creating inclusive and equitable
classrooms where every student can access high-quality math instruction.

Chapter 4 emphasizes the importance of culturally responsive teaching in
mathematics education. It recognizes that students' cultural backgrounds and
experiences play a crucial role in their mathematical understanding. By
incorporating culturally relevant examples and contexts, teachers can foster
student engagement and deepen their mathematical understanding. The framework
equips me as a math coach to support teachers in creating culturally responsive
classrooms that celebrate diversity and promote a positive math identity for all
students.

Chapter 5 focuses on assessment practices that are aligned with the principles
of equity and student-centered learning. It emphasizes the use of formative
assessment strategies to inform instructional decisions and provide timely
feedback to students. This chapter enables teachers to make data-driven
instructional choices, ensuring that all students receive the necessary support
and intervention. As a math coach, I can help teachers implement effective
assessment practices that promote equitable learning opportunities for all
students.

Chapter 6, as previously mentioned, promotes a balanced approach to teaching
mathematics by integrating procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. This
chapter equips teachers with the tools to develop students' mathematical
proficiency while fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts that
centers on ‚ÄúBig Ideas.‚Äù As a math coach, I can help teachers navigate this
balance and provide guidance on instructional strategies that promote both
procedural skills and conceptual understanding.

Chapters 9, 10, and 12 address the critical areas of technology integration,
family engagement, and professional learning, respectively. These chapters
recognize the importance of leveraging technology, involving families in the
mathematics learning process, and providing ongoing professional development
opportunities for teachers. As a math coach, I can utilize the framework to
support teachers in effectively integrating technology, fostering family
partnerships, and accessing relevant professional learning opportunities.

Finally, Chapter 13 is crucial as it provides guidance for curriculum publishers
to create better instructional materials that center on big ideas, use tasks
worthy of student engagement; and embed exercises in a larger context of
investigation. The materials provided currently that reflect the 2013 framework
require teachers to completely rearrange and piece components together to create
a program that somewhat resembles the direction that we should be going in
mathematics education. These key changes in the materials that will result from
the new proposed framework will make the job of teachers so much easier.

In conclusion, the new California math framework addresses the pressing needs of
elementary students and promotes equity in mathematics education. Its
comprehensive approach, coupled with specific guidance, provides me as a math
coach with a valuable tool to support teachers in transforming the math
experience of their students. The framework's ability to answer questions that
were previously unanswered by the previous framework will undoubtedly lead to
improved student outcomes and a more equitable mathematics education system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I encourage the State Board of
Education to adopt the new California math framework for the benefit of all
students across the state.

Sincerely,

Stephanie Holloway
Elementary Math Coach

Despite being toned down in recent revisions it is still flawed at the core in
its promotion of social justice throughout. It claims that each component of
classroom instruction is based on research and supported by practice, but let's
examine that. When it says that it is 'based on research', does this refer to
research produced by education schools, which are broadly considered to be the
intellectual dregs of academia? Why should this research be trusted? Last year I
got to talk with a student going for his educational doctorate who eventually
decided to leave the program. He said that his advisor had a long-standing
theory that she had worked so long on that any research that went against her
theory was no different than going against her personally, so that the only
acceptable 'research' was that which further supported her theory. In other
words, don't expect to get your degree if your findings contradict my dogma. Is
that the sort of research we're talking about?

How about the second part? 'supported by practice'. What practice are these
components supported by? By 'practice' do you mean that these components are
already used in schools? Are these the same schools that keep getting worse and
worse every year?

If 1) social justice has become increasingly a part of education based on
research, and 2) students increasingly can't do math, why exactly should we
listen to that research? If students were doing better in math before social
justice had been shoehorned into every nook and cranny of math education, why
would we double down on the idea? Research is only useful if it is falsifiable,
and if researchers and practitioners are honest with themselves about whether
something is working. You are not being honest with yourselves. The best way to
make these students to feel good about themselves is to give them general,
transferrable skills, not to try and tap into their emotions.

Stop trying to teach outside of your area of expertise. Many K-12 teachers are
barely competent to teach math, but at least they have some training in that.
They have no training in social work.

Stop trying to shove politics into our schools. Teach students how to think in a
disciplined, organized manner, and they'll have the tools to come to their own
conclusions. We don't give you our children in order to indoctrinate them into
whatever weak ideologies your handful of years in our universities' weakest
programs indoctrinated you with.

neighborhood in San Diego, where our local high school, Kearny, is 89%
non-white. Until just recently when I began working full-time, we were a
low-income, working-class family.

I set the context because I am appalled and saddened that California would want
to punish someone like my son who was identified as profoundly gifted at age 6.
He *adored* math and began algebra at age 8, moving into geometry in 4th grade
and calculus in middle school. Imagine if he was held back because of low
expectations. I would have crushed his intellectual curiosity. Instead, I let
him fly, pursuing what he loved, and he graduated from MIT 7 years ago debt-free
because MIT was so generous with need-based aid.

As an ex-public school teacher who saw the writing on the wall early with my
son, I chose to homeschool him because I knew he would be subjected to the
bigotry of low expectations in public school.

We need to raise the bar for all children, but perhaps most particularly,
students from under-represented groups! Lowing math standards would be a
disaster! California public education is already near the bottom of the country
in results. We've strayed away from excellence in education and from teaching

'engagement,' 'cultural relevance,' and other issues that better belong in other

David Margulies,,DavidsBirdsAndTrees@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"The Framework gives significant self-contradictory guidance on
middle school acceleration paths that needs to be fixed before this Framework
can become policy. These are drastic revisions required or the Framework must be
rejected.
One example is the Framework‚Äôs description of a claimed middle school
acceleration pathway on Chapter 8 line 825 (shown at the bottom), where a
student Kai takes ‚ÄúMathematics I and II in junior high and Mathematics III
during the first year of high school‚Äù.
If this student is in a district with a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade
experience‚Äù with Mathematics I starting in 9th grade, which is the district the
Framework guides for in their math pathway diagram Figure 8.4 and accompanying
description, the district would be forcing the student to repeat classes the
student is already proficient in. This is illegal as defined by the education
codes EDC 51224.7, EDC 51228.2, and EDC 51224.5. Since, for a district that
imposed a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù on its students with Math I
starting in 9th grade, this student Kai would not be able to move on in the math
pathway she is currently on because that district would have to offer a variety
of classes to its 9th grade students including Mathematics I, Mathematics II,
and Mathematics III, in short, not a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù
with Math I in 9th, it is clear that this pathway does not exist in a district
that adopts the Framework‚Äôs recommendation of a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade
experience‚Äù with Math I in 9th grade . The Framework needs to make it perfectly
clear that this pathway is not possible in a district that adopts the Framework
and the Framework‚Äôs recommendation of a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade
experience‚Äù with Math I in 9th. A public document cannot be misleading to
districts.
Phrasing needs to be inserted at the beginning of the section to clearly clarify
this to districts such that contradictory guidance is not given. It needs to be
amended, perhaps as follows:
Insert above Ch 8, L 825:
‚ÄúFor a district that does not impose a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade
experience‚Äù with Math I in 9th on its students, and allows multiple student
pathways in grades before 11, especially those of acceleration where
acceleration means enabling students to enroll in a class a grade level, or in
the case of the student described below, two grades levels above her peers, and
especially in middle school, in short, in a district that DOES NOT ADOPT the
Framework, then the following example pathway is possible:
The above to inserted above the Framework quote C 8 L 825 repeated below:
‚ÄúThe student Kai is interested in robotics engineering and was able to take
Mathematics I and II in junior high and Mathematics III during the first year of
high school. By completing Precalculus in the second year, Kai is able to take
AP Calculus in the third year. This enables multiple options for Kai‚Äôs fourth
year, such as taking her school‚Äôs data science course, or a programming and data
science course at the local community college, multivariable calculus, or other
college courses.‚Äù
It is obvious this student Kai lives in a district which has accelerated math
pathways in middle school. This pathway of Kai, and a district which has a
‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù with Math I starting in 9th grade as
the Framework guides for, are fundamentally self-contradictory. It is
unacceptable to have a document that can affect so many children nationwide to
be fraught with obvious inconsistencies. A major revision is required or this
Framework must not be approved.

research, and I oppose implementing them.

Sufficient objections have been raised by Tom Loveless, who has a BA from UC
Berkeley and a PhD from the University of Chicago, one of our nation's premier
research universities. Loveless points out that those who support implementing
the new standards have based their research on studies that fail to meet
scientific standards. I encourage you to read his article on Education Next:

As an educator, I believe that if these standards are introduced, we will see a
widening achievement gap in math, statewide, between wealthy and poor students.
Students with wealthy or educated parents will either purchase supplemental
instruction or provide it themselves to their kids. Poor families, stuck with an
unproven and in fact harmful system, will simply fall farther behind. ",SBECOMMENT-20230706-190845,7/6/2023 7:08 PM,,,,
Sampson Shen,,sampsonshen@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"First of all, the committee is trying to ram this proposal through
with a public comment period just after school year ends when many people are on
vacation, and allowing only a shambolic 2 week review period when there are more
than 1000 pages of material to be reviewed. Is the committee concerned about the
unpopularity of the CMF that it is not willing to provide a reasonable public
comment period? This is akin to the White House trying to hide bad news from the
public by releasing it on a Friday evening.

Second of all, this CMF is baloney. The framework substantially reduces the
rigor of the math curriculum so students can feel good about themselves for
achieving more to a lower standard. This is merely creating an illusion for the
students that they are achieving something when in fact they are merely falling
further behind compared to other states, and other countries in the world. If
one wants to see what a rigorous math curriculum looks like, they can just get
an elementary math book from Singapore, which is readily sold online in the
United States, and one can see that by the fifth grade, Singapore students are
already at least 1 grade level farther along than the current common core
standard. And the CMF is reducing the rigor of the curriculum even further in
the name of 'helping more students'. An A achieved with a lower standard is just
illusory achievement. The sense of accomplishment and belonging you are trying
to instill is just as fake, and no different from giving everyone who
participate in a sports competition a medal merely for participating.

Besides the concerns I have of the CMF, I also have tremendous concern about how
the CMF was drafted. As of 2020, California is a highly diverse state with 40%
Latino and 15% Asian. The CMF was drafted with heavy input from white math
education researchers who make recommendations on how math should be taught to
the colored communities, but these researchers have minimal exposure on actual
day-to-day struggles of these communities, AND stand to profit handsomely from
their consulting on math education/ framework with such communities. Case in
point, Jo Boaler and her $5000/ hr consulting with the Oxnard school district.
That is a blatant conflict of interest and needs to be called out as highly
unethical.

Please fix the CMF by increasing the rigor of the curriculum, and before that,
form a committee that reflects the current demographic makeup of the state.

than prioritizing the excellence in math education that our children deserve. It
is crucial that we steer ourselves towards quantifiable goals, such as the NAEP
math assessments, which provide a reliable benchmark for measuring student
proficiency. We should strive to achieve scores that meet or exceed results from
kids in Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho.

Regrettably, the current framework lacks the necessary clarity and foresight.

I implore you to reconsider and adopt an alternative framework that places a
strong emphasis on objectivity and measurable outcomes. Our primary goal should
be to teach math in its purest form, devoid of any political influences. By
doing so, we can provide our children with a well-rounded education that equips
them for a future filled with opportunities.

Kids deserve a rigorous, flexible math curriculum that empowers them to excel,

the material at home in their limited free time. Using their precious free time
(which should be dedicated to extra curriculars, family, homework or relaxation)
to learn the basics of geometry given that the BIG IDEAS textbook was so
remedial, repetitive and insufficient.

The new framework is not based on data driven research. It has been uniformly
criticized by experts in mathematics and teachers.

I dedicate my volunteer hours to increase equity and access for TSP students in
accelerated gifted pathways. We need to improve very early education and gifted
identification. We need to allow our accelerated learners - from all economic,
cultural and racial backgrounds- to have the support and encouragement they need
in order to fulfill their potential.

The problems we face as a world are going to require great minds with advanced
educations. We need stem innovators, we need students who are radically,
accelerated in mathematics and all sciences. Our planet is broken and we need to
build a generation of thinkers inventors and creators. We cannot do that by
believing that equity equals uniformity. We must allow athletes to succeed in
athletics, just as we allow mathematicians to succeed in mathematics. We don‚Äôt
cripple our fastest runners and it is undathomable to me that we celebrate a
gymnastics prodigy but want to bridle and restrain a math whiz. This is anti
intellectualism at its worst and most insidious.

I‚Äôm sure you are aware mathematicians do their greatest work in their 20s and
early 30s. We cannot hobble our youth by preventing them from accelerating in
math if that is something that they are willing interested and able to do. We
will drive our brightest into the private school sector. Furthermore, we will
radicalized parents and send them to the far right. We are already seeing the
catastrophic affects of the radical right in much of California. However,
initiatives like the California math framework will push moderates to the right.
Sadly, only the right seems to be their ally in this argument, and that is
devastating. It will have a ripple effect into politics as well. All because
California is taking the advice of a woman who should not only not be listened
to, but who should be criticized and dismissed for her lack of ethics in
misrepresenting data and parading opinion as fact.

Will we stop young children from reading novels if they are inclined to do so?
This is seeming very ‚Äúbrave new world‚Äù to me.

The new math framework is an embarrassment to California. We are already lagging
many behind many other countries in stem. This new framework will aggravate the
problem. The fact that you are listening to the advice of someone who seems to
be inclined to be promoting her own textbooks and op-eds instead of listening to
the hundreds of mathematicians and stem professionals telling you that this is
bad research is deeply troubling to me.

Acceleration works. That fact is backed up by research across the board.
Tracking may or may not always work, but radical acceleration produces PhD‚Äòs. It
produces patents. It produces scientists. This is proven. Denying acceleration
to gifted children destroys their passion for education and it is cruel.

We need to offer the opportunity to accelerate to all of our students. And we
need to improve math education for those who are not accelerated. Most students
don‚Äôt need calculus. Perhaps we need to rethink that. But we certainly need many
of our students to learn calculus in order to succeed in fields that require it.
And if those students want to learn calculus in fourth grade 8th grade 10th
grade‚ÄîTerrific. We need those kids; they‚Äôre going to fix the world. ",SBECOMMENT-20230706-223436,7/6/2023 10:34 PM,,,,

David Margulies,,DavidsBirdsAndTrees@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"The Framework should be rejected because the policies it is
recommending California adopt violate education codes. The Framework recommends
in Chapter 8 line 701 ‚ÄúFigure 8.4 below indicates possible pathways for high
school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a
broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade.‚Äù Education codes EDC
51224.7, EDC 51228.2, and EDC 51224.5 clearly articulate that:
1) 9th grade math course placement is recognized as being very important in the
careers of students.
2) It is expected that the math course placement of one student will differ from
the next. This is obvious because, if it was not, then there would be no need
for a ‚ÄúMath Placement Act‚Äù. If a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù was
expected, there would be no need to be concerned with placing students in
different classes. There would be no need for a ‚ÄúMath Placement Act‚Äù as students
would all be having a ‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù and be placed
in the same class. That is, there would be no need to place students in
different classes. The law dictates students should be placed in different
classes based on their proficiency and have an experience substantially
different than some other students, and specifically, as dictated by law, not a
‚Äúcommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù.
3) Fair and objective testing is required by law to be used to determine which
course the student is to be properly placed in. This means it is expected that
the placement of one student will be different from the next, and a student is
allowed to demonstrate which class he/she is to be properly placed in by
performance on a test, among other methods. This makes it illegal for districts
to place all students in the same class which would be to impose a ‚Äúcommon
ninth- and tenth-grade experience‚Äù on its students .
Since this Framework is guiding districts to impose an ILLEGAL policy on its
students, the Framework must either:
1) CLEARLY explain to districts that this is illegal.
2) Excise from the Framework the parts of the Framework that guide districts
towards this ILLEGAL policy, that is remove the phrase a ‚Äùcommon ninth- and
tenth-grade experience‚Äù and all guidance associated with it.
3) Not adopt the Framework. The State Board of Education must vote to not adopt
the Framework.
Since the illegality of this wording in the Framework has been present in all
three drafts, and this has been clearly pointed out to the writers of the
Framework in Public Comment, it is clear that this wording is both the intention
of the Framework writers and that they continue to write this disregarding the
knowledge of its illegality. This shows complete and utter negligence on the
part of the Framework writers, a dereliction of duty, and therefore the best
solution is for the Framework to not be adopted and for the writing of the
Framework be started over from scratch by a group of writers that are willing to
not guide districts to invoke policies that break the law.

My daughter will not be enrolling her 4 year old daughter in public school,
since everything 'taught' there is so politicized. I agree with everything Palos
verdes Peninsula School Board Member, Julie Hamill said below: f I were in
charge of creating a new math framework, I would look to places where children
are excelling in math and borrow their strategies.

Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho have the highest NAEP scores in Math. First
generation Chinese immigrants in our community explained to me the drilling and
repetition they learned in school, and wonder why we cannot implement the same
here ‚Äì because it works.

Instead, California's proposed framework is heavy on critical theory and
political buzzwords, light on actual math. It reads like an instructional manual
on social justice ‚Äì not how to teach math.

While this may appeal to those who identify with the far left, it repels
everyone else, and FAILS THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY TEACHING MATH.

The stated focus is equity ‚Äì for which there are no measurable objective
benchmarks. In fact, I did not find anything in the framework regarding how to
measure success.

The framework defines equity as: ‚Äúfairness in education rather than
sameness....equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access
to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes and
success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4)
Attention to relations of power.‚Äù

First of all - sameness is important in math. There is only one correct answer
to a mathematical problem. That is how math works. Secondly - Do kids really
need to be focused on student identity development in math, or attention to
relations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is objectively
insane to me.

From the overview: ‚ÄúThe goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning
so that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better
understand and positively impact the world‚Äîin their careers, in college, and in
civic life.‚Äù

From Chapter 1: ‚ÄúReflecting the state‚Äôs commitment to equity, every chapter in
this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help
mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.‚Äù

Equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2,
9 and 10.

The framework is also focused on ‚Äúenvironmental literacy‚Äù ‚Äì which has nothing to
do with learning math.

In summary, the horse is out of the barn on this framework and I don‚Äôt think
anything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the office
of superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. They are using their
positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas.

My recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new
framework based on those that have proven successful ‚Äì like those in
Massachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters.

Instead, our government has taken a non-political subject ‚Äì MATH ‚Äì heavily
politicized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for ‚Äúequity‚Äù ‚Äì
whatever that means.

Here is the framework: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/

Public comments due tomorrow July 7 at noon here:

Foundations for Data Science.

A growing evidence base suggests significant value for K-12 data science
programs and their positive impact on students trajectories. While these
programs may appear new, they build upon a strong foundation of education
research and learning science literature stretching back over a decade.

Between 2013 and 2018, National Science Foundation grants supported the
development of high school data science courses, curricula, and K-12 classroom
software. Today, over 70+ classroom resources are available for K-12 data
science education.

In 2019, an international consortium of researchers published the IDSSP

forwarding a common framework for stand-alone high school courses across
countries.

In 2021, the Institute of Education Sciences released a Technical Working Group
for K-12 data science education, that highlighted significant opportunities for
student engagement, greater diversity in STEM education, and additional research
opportunities to forward the field. In my capacity as a former researcher for
the U.S. Department of Education‚Äôs Institute of Education Sciences (IES), I
helped to gather evidence and diverse research expertise for this report, all
which demonstrated significant potential value for students' mathematics
learning if scaled.

In 2022, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released
their first national proceedings that cataloged a diverse array of K-12 data
science programs around the country. The report and commissioned papers
highlighted the uniquely strong student engagement, positive identity formation,
and rigorous mathematical thinking that students gain from diverse curriculum
programs around the country ‚Äì gathered through over 60 field-submitted
case-studies, educator interviews, and 6 expert panel discussions over two days.

science course programs in California (attached) that show relative gains for
student attitudes toward mathematics, interest in STEM, confidence in STEM
skills, and greater math course-taking when given the opportunity to enroll in a
high school data science course. This study is pre-publication and still subject
to peer review, but we are sharing now given the forthcoming framework decision
deadline. We believe this is yet another indication among many that K-12 data
science programs have strong potential to bring students into STEM pathways who
would not otherwise consider these options ‚Äì providing students the motivation
to learn additional mathematics in high school and higher education that is
required for STEM degree programs.

Firstly, thank you for your hard work and dedication toward improving math
achievement for our students. We're on the same team.

With that said, I strongly believe the Board should reject the proposed math
framework.

My three main reasons:

1. Tom Loveless, the accomplished education researcher policy author of 16
volumes of the Brown Center Report on American Education, summarized the main
concerns about the framework's severe lack of quality research in his writing
here:
https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/evidence-struggling-math-students-and-californias-2022-math-framework
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/evidence-struggling-math-students-and-californias-2022-math-framework__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5zeU3nGcw$]

The part that stood out to me the most was: 'The 2022 California Math Framework
does not reflect current scholarship on how to serve students who struggle when
learning mathematics. A search of studies cited in a recent What Works
Clearinghouse publication, ‚ÄúAssisting Students Struggling with Mathematics:
Intervention in the Elementary Grades,‚Äù reveals absolutely no overlap. ... the
process employed to search literature and select evidence for the framework‚Äôs
recommendations is unknown.'

2. In January 2022, one of the framework's co-authors, Katy Early, gave a
presentation titled 'Teaching to Big Ideas' to our district's elementary staff.
One concern was that she distributed an article, which as a district we took
time to discuss, that denigrated timed math fluency practice. However, timed
math fluency practice has strong evidence, according to the federal What Works
Clearinghouses's practice guide on assisting struggling math students
(https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5yMwYAdtg$]).
The article she distributed mentioned anxiety related to timed math fluency
practice, but the truth is 'No studies have determined that timed tests cause
math anxiety - defined as feelings of apprehension, tension, or fear that may
interfere with performance on math-related tasks.(a) In fact, timed tactics
improve math performance.(b),' according to the experts at Science of Math group
(www.scienceofmath.com
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.scienceofmath.com__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5wOycekEw$]).
I asked Katy about the research behind the framework and her answer wasn't much
beyond 'it's got research behind it.' The result was some of our staff were
convinced we should not have math fact expectations or timed fluency practice
anymore. This is sad and frustrating and bad for our kids. The framework wields
immediate influence to the detriment of our students.

3. My final reason is presented as a set of questions for decision-makers such
as yourself, and these come from Amanda VanDerHeyden, who is part of the Science
of Math group:

What do university mathematics professors think of the revised framework (not
math ed professors, but mathematics and more broadly, STEM professors)?

What evidence do you have from well-controlled experimental studies that these
revisions will produce benefits to students? Where are the field trials that
have been through peer-review and show benefit? What are the measured costs or
side-effects?

What are the effects on learning for students from various backgrounds and
starting skill levels?

What are the operationalized training models that will equip teachers to deliver
the new framework with sufficient integrity? What evidence can you show from
rigorous research studies demonstrating that your manualized training systems
will equip teachers to implement?

Who advised changing both the instructional scheme (your independent variable)
and your measurement scheme (your dependent variables and measures) at the same
time? This is basic science 101 and doing this means that CA students' rights
are not being protected.

What is the alignment of the instruction (targets, methods) and assessments
proposed in the new framework with the last 30 years of policy guidance and
funded federal research (e.g., the IES practice guides in mathematics that
summarize research evidence, national panels)?

Where are the voices & citations of the well-regarded substantive researchers in
mathematical learning from all branches of psychology, from mathematics, from
special education?

California needs to do more to meet the mathematics learning needs of ALL
students. This draft Mathematics Framework, when implemented with integrity,
will challenge all of us, as it should, to stretch and grow and learn for the
benefit of our students and their futures. This Framework communicates we are
paying attention to the data and listening to the voices of all students,
including our most vulnerable.

As a grandparent, retired high school math teacher (from AP Calculus through
alternative education), coach for new math teachers and member of the 2013 CA
Math Framework Committee, I support the 2023 Revised Draft Mathematics Framework
as recommended by the California Department of Education. I urge you to adopt
this Framework as presented.

I shared my vision for mathematics learning at one of the 2019 Focus Group
meetings. I was not alone. The SBE listened to suggestions from myself and
others and approved guidelines that address the needs of all students and
clarifies and builds upon the previous Framework. Through both public reviews, I
continued to share my thoughts, concerns and appreciation as an individual and
as a member of caring math educator communities. I signed the California Math
Council‚Äôs letter of support along with hundreds (2800+) of others.

Some highlights of this Framework for me, to name a few of many:
‚Ä¢ Support for all learners
‚Ä¢ Guiding principles toward equity in mathematics instruction (Ch. 1, p. 11)
‚Ä¢ Five components of instructional design (Ch. 2, pp. 10- )
‚Ä¢ Assets-based approach to instruction (Ch. 2, p. 8)
‚Ä¢ Support for meaningful mathematics, including cultural and personal relevance
(Ch. 2, p. 11)
‚Ä¢ Emphasis on Big Ideas and coherence across grades (Ch. 1, pp. 15-18, Ch. 2, p.
13)
‚Ä¢ Designing instruction with integration in mind (Ch. 8, p. 25, 54)
‚Ä¢ Rigorous pathways in addition to the common pre-calculus/calculus pathway with
more choices for third- and fourth-year courses. (Ch. 8, pp. 29-31)
‚Ä¢ Elevate real-world application of mathematics understanding (Ch. 8, p. 32)
‚Ä¢ Reasoning with data (Ch. 1, p. 24)

The challenge to create an advisory, guiding document that is exactly what all
stakeholders desire is an impossible task. This is an excellent document. All of
the persons involved in this monumental task of creating this forward-thinking
document should be commended for their diligence in following the guidelines
approved by the State Board in 2019 and be thanked for their huge investment of
time for the benefit of all students.

needed for reproducing mathematics facts‚Äîis compromised.‚Äù
WRONG! Overlearning facts and testing KNOWLEDGE helps! Whereas the 2013
Framework advocated for a MIX of rote learning to support development of fluency
and problem-solving in instruction, in this revised Framework there is much
discussion about how rote learning is a problem and that assessment and math
education must instead focus on testing complex reasoning problems to avoid
disadvantaging people with math anxiety. In fact, this is the opposite of what
is best for students with high math anxiety. This was demonstrated long ago as
the anxiety-to-complexity effect (Faust, Ashcroft, and Fleck, 1996) ‚ÄúThe more
difficult or complex the arithmetic problem, the more disadvantaged high maths
anxious subjects are, in terms of either speed of processing or accuracy‚Äù. Yes,
working memory that supports mental flexibility needed for reasoning problems is
vulnerable to distraction and anxiety, but retrieval of facts depends on a
different mental process, semantic or declarative memory, not working memory.
Reproducing mathematics facts, if heavily overlearned, will likely make student
performance MORE resilient against math anxiety during testing. Having a strong
‚Äúconceptual‚Äù representation depends on learning which involves both rehearsal of
arbitrary facts as well as learning conceptual relationships. But to dismiss as
unimportant an entire approach to learning, notably practice, is as unwise as
cutting out part of our brains. Chunking is an example of how our limited
capacity, working memory system, benefits from facts. Working memory capacity is
typically limited to 5 elements + or ‚Äì 2. Imagine holding in mind a short series
of letters one has just heard (a g r z), or repeating those letters in reverse
alphabetical order (z r g a). That is working memory. One can vastly expand
working memory capacity for holding in mind letters with arbitrary facts of how
to spell words linked to knowledge (e.g. if one groups letters into the words
apple green red zero-17 letters held in mind!). The same principles are used in
other fields. Musicians learn scales and arpeggios they practice to automaticity
and these patterns enable them to play more fluently. Baseball pitchers and
other ball-sports learn procedures to throw balls a high speeds. Riding a
bicycle involves procedural fluency in the mechanics of the device to enable
navigation to new places. Similarly, math relies on multiple mental processes
that require fluency. If one has to figure out why 2+2=4 then then this process
will compete for this limited capacity of working memory. Lack of practice to
automaticity for students with math anxiety may indeed lead to those students
having trouble retrieving facts but this would instead be due to inadequate
instruction. And this situation is what the Framework is advocating.

Dear President Darling-Hammond and Members of the State Board of Education:

I, Ma Bernadette Andres-Salgarino, am writing to express my wholehearted support
for the revised Mathematics Framework. As the President-Elect of the CA
Mathematics Council, Board Member of TODOS Mathematics for All, and a member of
Math CFCC, I am committed to advocating for a high-quality mathematics education
that propels the success of ALL students in college, career, and life.

The revised Mathematics Framework is a significant step in addressing the urgent
need to improve mathematics teaching and learning. It strongly emphasizes equity
and excellence, recognizing and celebrating students' diverse backgrounds,
genders, races, cultures, religions, and achievements. Furthermore, it outlines
clear strategies to ensure that every student receives the necessary support and
challenges to thrive in their chosen pathways to success.

A key strength of the revised Mathematics Framework is its student-centered
approach. It provides comprehensive guidance to educators in establishing a
system of support that aligns with rigorous, focused, and coherent standards, as
exemplified through the Big Ideas. By centering on students, the framework
fosters engagement and ownership of learning, empowering students to become
active participants in their mathematical journey.

I am particularly enthusiastic about the framework‚Äôs emphasis on expanding
access to joyful and relevant mathematics through Data Science for TK - 12. By
equipping students with the knowledge, understanding, and skills to use data as
a tool for mathematical reasoning and problem-solving, the revised Mathematics
Framework ensures that students are prepared to navigate the increasingly
data-driven world. This focus on Data Science will enhance students‚Äô critical
thinking and analytical abilities, enabling them to make informed decisions and
contributions to society.

Equally important is the framework‚Äôs dedication to inclusivity and belonging. It
provides strategies to support diverse learners, including Multilingual
Learners, students with disabilities, and students from historically
marginalized communities. This commitment to inclusivity ensures that all
students have equitable access to high-quality mathematics education, fostering
a sense of belonging and creating opportunities for success.

As a parent and an experienced educator, I implore the State Board of Education
to adopt the 2023 Mathematics Framework. This framework empowers students and
their families, maximizing opportunities for growth and development. California
cannot afford to wait any longer; we must take bold action to propel our
children forward and enable them to thrive. For these compelling reasons, I
wholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework.

Thank you for your attention on this critical matter.

now with math. Neuroscience showed us that learning phonics is vital and should
not be subjugated to social emotional learning. The ultimate irony was a
reference in CMF to an fMRI study that compared 15 students with and 15 students
without math learning disability that used the CMF 2013 techniques and showed
brain activity normalized in students with math learning disabilities. Here is
the quote.
‚ÄúOne study conducted by neuroscientists in Stanford‚Äôs School of Medicine
examined the effects of a tutoring intervention with students who had been
diagnosed as having mathematics ‚Äúlearning disabilities‚Äù and those with no
identified difficulties in mathematics (Luculano et al., 2015). Prior to the
intervention, the group of students with identified ‚Äúlearning disabilities‚Äù had
lower mathematics performance and different brain activation patterns than
students who had no identified difficulties in mathematics. After eight weeks of
one-on-one tutoring focused on strengthening student understanding of
relationships between and within operations, not only did both sets of students

anything about ‚Äúall students‚Äù on the basis of a tiny group of 15 students with

Should injecting ideology take precedence over academic outcomes in the
California Math Framework (CMF)?

Please reject the CMF Third Field Review (TFR) and retain the 2013 CMF.

The CMF‚Äôs Third Field Review begins by discussing CA students‚Äô poor math
proficiency, and then claims that this poor performance demands implementation
of its ideological and pedagogical proposals, ignoring that its proposals may
actually make student proficiency worse.

The same TFR proposals made student proficiency worse at SFUSD, where detracking
and equity focused proposals have been implemented since 2014. SFUSD‚Äôs math
program, the TFR‚Äôs mirror image, has led to decreased student math proficiency
and increased inequity. (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19; see SFUSD

see FFSF Inequity in Numbers report, see ‚ÄòPut Algebra 1 back in 8th Grade‚Äô,
Ridgeway, Margulies)

Now that the failure of SFUSD‚Äôs math program is known, it isn‚Äôt mentioned in the
TFR, though SFUSD did figure prominently in the CMF‚Äôs First Field Review (FFR).
By avoiding mention of SFUSD, the TFR avoids drawing attention to the failure of
its own proposals. This tactic isn‚Äôt surprising, as the TFR continues to propose
implementing these same failed proposals for all of CA‚Äôs almost 6 million public
school children.

Even the evidence the TFR does put forward to support its signature detracking
proposal, from which so many of its other proposals stem, is compromised. The
key supporting study in the TFR, known as ‚ÄòThe Railside Study,‚Äô has been heavily
critiqued and some would say, discredited. Further, its lead author, a writer of
the CMF, hasn‚Äôt responded to requests to share data, to permit independent
verification of its results.

Another key detracking paper cited in the TFR, ‚ÄòRaising Expectations...‚Äô 2021,
is an unpublished, non peer reviewed, scantily detailed paper, which one
commentator called ‚Äòa blog post‚Äô (see @mikeandallie tweets).

The one study the TFR cites that shows detracking student benefit, is
misrepresented, by shading discussion of the study‚Äôs findings to emphasize just
the detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention, presumably because it
is a study of 8th grade Algebra acceleration for all, which the TFR discourages.

‚ÄòThe Railside Study‚Äô and the ‚ÄòRaising Expectations...‚Äù papers claim that
detracking leads to student academic benefit, but neither can reliably support
that conclusion. SFUSD‚Äôs results certainly do not support it.

Detracking is the core TFR go-to proposal, from which other proposals stem, such
as heterogeneous (differing student math level) classrooms (through 10th grade),
the use of ‚Äòbig ideas‚Äô and ‚Äòrich‚Äô ‚Äòopen‚Äô math tasks to permit multiple entry
level points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels, and
the use of ‚ÄòComplex Instruction‚Äô, to manage interactions in the heterogeneous
classroom. None of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student
academic outcomes. In any case, SFUSD has already implemented all of these
proposals as a package, and the result was decreased student math proficiency
(See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19), and increased inequity (see ‚ÄòPut
Algebra 1 back in 8th grade‚Äô, Ridgeway, Margulies).

TFR suggests implementing the same proposals statewide.

Is it because the TFR‚Äôs ideological commitment to detracking, 'equity',
'equitable outcomes' takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes?
At times, the TFR reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum
framework.

For example, the TFR says the CMF‚Äôs goal is ‚Äòequity‚Äô (Ch. 1). The TFR‚Äôs Glossary
defines ‚Äòequity‚Äô as ‚Äòfairness, not sameness‚Äô, but ‚Äòfairness‚Äô and ‚Äòsameness‚Äô
aren‚Äôt similarly defined. The ‚Äòequity‚Äô definition points to a paper, Gutierrez
(2012) (‚ÄúContext Matters‚Ä¶‚Äù), and a rubric within the paper, to explain how
achieving equity in math education will occur. The 4 dimension rubric, however,
is based on Marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics (see
page 20 in ‚ÄúContext Matters‚Ä¶‚Äù Gutierrez 2012).

The TFR text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from Critical Race
Theory, like ‚Äòequity‚Äô, ‚Äòequitable outcomes,‚Äô ‚Äòsystemic change,‚Äô ‚Äòsystemic
issues, ‚Äòexamine inequities,‚Äô‚Äòstructural barriers,‚Äô ‚Äòstructural injustices‚Äô,
‚Äòinstitutional injustices‚Äô, ‚Äòchallenge the status quo‚Äô, ‚Äòsocial order‚Äô, ‚Äòculture
of exclusion‚Äô, ‚Äòinequitable‚Äô, ‚Äòinequities,‚Äô ‚Äòchallenge inequities,‚Äô ‚Äòstructural
inequities,‚Äô ‚Äòsystemic inequities,‚Äô ‚Äòhistorically marginalized‚Äô, and
‚Äòhistorically underrepresented,‚Äô all of which are part of the CRT lexicon, and
stem from its core tenet of ‚Äòsystemic racism‚Äô. CRT‚Äôs contested ideology, derived
from Marxism, can be described as

‚ÄúIt (CRT) is a Marxian faith system based on the belief that society is
organized by white people for their own benefit through something Critical Race
theorists call ‚Äòsystemic racism.‚Äô‚Äù (James Lindsay, ‚ÄòWhat is Critical Race
Theory‚Äô Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 1, (8:22 and onward) -
https:newdiscourses.com)

‚ÄòAwakening a ‚Äútrue‚Äù racial consciousness that is aware of this (systemic racism)
and that unequivocally rejects it (and whiteness itself as its root) is
therefore the chief program of Critical Race Theory.‚Äô (James Lindsay, ‚ÄòRace
Marxism‚Äô, New Discourses, pg. 13)
While Critical Race Theory aims to raise a ‚Äòracial consciousness‚Äô; the TFR
promoted pedagogy, Culturally Relevant Teaching, aims to raise a ‚Äòcritical
consciousness‚Äô.

According to the Calif Dept. of Education (CDE)
(https://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ee/culturalrelevantpedagogy.asp), Culturally Relevant
Teaching consists of three components, all of which ‚Äòmust be utilized‚Äô,
including supporting a students‚Äô ‚Äòcritical consciousness,‚Äô which is the ability
to recognize and critique societal inequalities. The term, ‚ÄòCritical
consciousness‚Äô, comes from the Brazilian Marxist Paulo Freire, and is designed
to create Marxist political activists by engaging in Marxist thought reform (See
‚ÄòThe Marxification of Education‚Äô).

Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) also makes an appearance in the CMF TFR (Ch.
13). Strands of SEL, such as Transformational SEL, and others, also derive from
Marxism, according to New Discourses.

The TFR also includes elements from Gender Ideology, and a section on ‚ÄòTeaching
towards Social Justice‚Äô; suggesting both should be incorporated into math
curriculum and instruction.

It‚Äôs not just the prevalence of these ideologies in a proposed math curriculum
that‚Äôs a problem, it‚Äôs that the TFR favors ideological proposals known to lead
to academic failure. And it‚Äôs also that these ideologies, if implemented in
public school, would contravene a number of state and federal laws and
Constitutional provisions (see Kathryn Jordan public comment on the TFR).

The purpose of a state curriculum framework is to implement state standards, not
to inject woke ideologies. Reject the TFR; retain the 2013 CMF.

This plan is going to accomplish many things, but improve the children of
California's math skills is not going to be one of them. I wish I could say I
read everything completely but with the limited time you allowed to review and
over a holiday weekend, I was not able to accomplish that task as I will assumed
your release planned to accomplish minimum responses. From what I read, I'm
impressed. You took a basic subject such as math and politicized it with
solutions that will not only lower mathematical competency but put a larger
burden on the system especially those with task of teaching this subject.

I would suggest you look at areas where students thrive in Math and attempt to
emulate them. Countries such as China and Philippines have excelled in this
subject as have the states of Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho.

As a California student I was fortunate to be able to perform math functions
acceptability. My skill set wasn't the result of me being included or coming
from a higher economical background. I was good because I was taught the basic
and had to repetitively solve different problems that where presented to me.
Like anything, the more I did it the problems, the better myself and the
classmates who kept up did. It was a simple concept that will still work today.

I don't know how California lost it's way in basic teaching curriculum.
I guess the worry now must be pornographic books not being as your offices says
‚Äúbanned‚Äù from library. That would be threatening to certain students.

I don't know what math skills are going to be gained from teaching equity. Maybe
you will have to emphasize division in order to teach equality. Two subjects
that separate and devoid from each other.

Just like in a casino, I will have to wish the students of California a hardy

speaking from experience. The CMF places all students from a particular grade in
the same class, thus superficially eliminating the appearance of disparities. My
child has lived through these delaned classes in middle school. This one size
fits all classroom, with complex problems that have minimal reinforcement of
each student‚Äôs individual instructional needs, and it does not serve any of the
students. Complex word problems are hard for non-native speakers to understand
and find math concepts. Struggling students don‚Äôt get the extra practice and
close attention they need because only a fraction of the problem is relevant to
them. Students who have mastered the material are frustrated because they cannot
progress to their full potential. The excuse I was repeatedly given for making
my child repeat material she has already mastered in these classrooms is that
she would have ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù learning but I have spent many years looking in the
scientific literature and have found NO operational definition of the concept or
demonstration that heterogeneous classes geared at lower level instruction help
students. Instead, parents of these advanced students who have means pay for
external classes and tutors during middle school to overcome this problem.

In high school, those without financial means that have not had this enrichment
and can‚Äôt compete and likely receive lower grades and grades determine whether
they have a chance at these highly competitive engineering programs. The Palo
Alto district they tried to enforce this delaning in high school. To accomplish
this they violated the California Math Placement Act by forcing most students
into the same Geometry class as high school freshmen (they made it a graduation
requirement) regardless of whether they already took the class. They refused to
perform testing to evaluate whether this class would benefit the student (this
was the legal violation). Struggling students complained about having stronger
students in their class because this caused them stress and was unfair
competition. Encouraging economically disadvantaged students that receive lower
grades to take ‚Äúdata science‚Äù instead of calculus sabotages their chances of a
STEM college degree. The San Francisco public school model of delaying Algebra 1
until high school made reaching calculus impossible without paying for external
classes, thus destroying any chance at equity for economically disadvantaged
students. Blocking access to calculus makes being accepted to college
engineering virtually impossible. Even if these students were allowed into these
programs, covering advanced math in high school saves STEM-aspiring,
economically disadvantaged students college tuition for those same courses. And
still worse, entering a STEM college program without adequate preparation makes
disadvantaged students vulnerable to being ‚Äúweeded out‚Äù and left with high

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I strongly oppose to the proposed California Math Framework. I have
been teaching math in California for 41 years and have a degree in mathematics.

I have carefully studied the proposed framework. It steers teachers away from
using clear direct instruction and from requiring their students to master math
facts and algorithms at the right stages of their mathematical development. For
example, students who do not memorize their times tables by the end of 3rd grade
typically struggle when they try to learn fractions in 4th grade, or decimals in
5th grade, etc. The Framework is opposed to the Common Core Standards on this
point -- yet the Framework is intended to help teachers implement the Common
Core Standards.

The proposed framework will be particularly harmful to students whose families
do not have the resources to pay for private math tutors or after-school classes
to supplement their math education. Affluent families will be better positioned
to seek outside help for their children to succeed in middle and high school
math and prepare for STEM careers. This will widen the existing achievement gap
even further.

There is no legitimate research to back up the claims of the Framework which in
many cases defy common sense. Instead, the claims are supported by blog posts by
one of the authors or by small scale studies with falsified data (none of it
peer-reviewed). It has been clearly established that the claimed success of San
Francisco's de-tracking experiment was actually based on false claims (or math
errors).

I fully support and endorse the ambitious vision of this proposed framework. I
urge you to adopt and support its implementation.

As mathematics lesson study participants, we have had the opportunity to apply
much of the research-based pedagogy stated in the draft Mathematics Framework
which has resulted in continuously seeing students change from non-participants
in mathematics classes to becoming mathematics thinkers and doers. From this
sample of CA classrooms and their existence proof, I am very much encouraged
that progress can be made. To implement this framework system wide will take
time, continuous professional learning, as well as ongoing communication with
the community.

I appreciate the framework highlighting data science since it is integral to
making sense of the jobs we do, citizenship responsibilities, medical decisions,
climate science, etc. It is essential for students to understand that data and
statistics impact every aspect of our lives. Understanding, critiquing, and
applying data science is essential if we are going to make reasoned decisions
about improvements. I would hope that educators can use data science as we
transition to using the ideas embedded in this framework to analyze our progress
and inquiries into implementation efforts understanding there will be strengths
and weaknesses in our efforts.

I am hopeful for teachers and students in our state that we will have the
opportunity to leverage this framework to craft meaningful mathematics learning
for our students and ourselves. The CA Board of Education and writing teams
should be commended for articulating this complex vision of mathematics
instruction and their investment in improving learning opportunities for each
and every California student.

Katherine Gardner,California Public School Parent,daisykpgardner@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I am writing as a parent and stakeholder with two children in
California‚Äôs public school system. My children attend high school and middle
school in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in the city of Los
Angeles, CA. They have attended CA public schools since they were in
kindergarten. (Stakeholders are addressed in Ch. 1 of the California Math
Framework.)

Our family is in a unique position in that our children have tried out both
traditional math programs and models that align with the new California Math
Framework in their respective schools. Having lived experience with the
recommendations put forth in the CMF, I am writing to urge the CA BOE to reject
the proposed California Math Framework in its current form.

I have heard the phrase, ‚Äúyour children are not a data set,‚Äù but they are the
data set I know the best. My kids took math at public schools that have adopted
the recommendations contained in the new CMF and math at public schools that did
not. Both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed CMF
models of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs
that did not employ the CMF‚Äôs recommendations.

My children‚Äôs first elementary school was an independent charter named Larchmont
Charter School in Los Angeles. Larchmont was an early adopter of the CMF‚Äôs
proposed models. Years before other public schools worked to align themselves
with the new CMF, faculty at Larchmont Charter School worked closely with UCLA‚Äôs
Center X / UCLA Mathematics Project to incorporate CGI Math into their
curriculum. Larchmont teachers followed Jo Boaler at Stanford and her work
building on Carol Dweck‚Äôs ‚Äúgrowth mindsets,‚Äù which guided them in creating model
math classrooms for their students. Larchmont was a high-performing school with
engaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the PD.

The resulting math program, however, was not effective for my two kids, both of
whom work several years above grade level. My students bemoaned the coursework,
which was remedial, repetitive, slow-paced, and featured a lot of writing about
their thinking for very simple concepts. Once they moved over to LAUSD proper,
which followed a more traditional math path, they both soared ahead and
discovered they loved math. In fifth grade, my daughter remarked, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt
believe Larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm!‚Äù

Using a standard algorithm (and just‚Ä¶doing math problems) made everything click
into place for these particular kids. I was therefore dismayed to see the
current CMF recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until
much later in elementary ‚Äì using culminating standards as a guide of when to
teach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the
Common Core (see elementary school guidance re: when multiplication, division,
etc. are taught, CMF page 83.)

But Larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models. Last year, in
LAUSD, our child‚Äôs former school, Gaspar de Portola Middle School implemented a
pilot program for the district that was aligned with the new CMF. Portola
switched from teaching the ‚ÄúBig Ideas‚Äù math curriculum to ‚ÄúIllustrative Math‚Äù in
2022-2023. Teachers underwent extensive PD. Parent booster groups spent tens of
thousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new
curriculum.

Again, the progressive math model (executed by excellent teachers and staff) was
a disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace. Gaspar de
Portola Middle School houses a Highly Gifted Magnet (HGM) for kids who typically
work 3 years ahead of grade level. Parents at the HGM, (knowing nothing about
the Math Wars raging in Sacramento) were incredibly dismayed by the new
curriculum.

One parent, a STEM PhD and retired astrophysicist, patiently did every problem
set in both the ‚ÄúBig Ideas‚Äù (traditional) textbook and the (new) ‚ÄúIllustrative
Math‚Äù textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the
new progressive model. Dismayed by what he found, he wrote a letter to our
principal, which I am excerpting here:

‚ÄúAs for IM, first of all, I strongly applaud LAUSD and Portola's initiative and
effort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state
of math proficiency in the general student population in LAUSD and in the
country. IM textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited
to many, if not most student's needs and ability. IM tries to make students
fully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by
reorganizing math topics, offering a lot of repetitions, and showing various
ways to explain the same concepts. My son (*name withheld) I believe, is
benefitting from IM‚Äôs methodology, repetitiveness, and slower pace.‚Äù

‚ÄúHowever, I have to say that IM does not serve HGM kids‚Äô needs well at all
(especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond) and
is a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability. Ultimately it does
not prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like Pre-Cal and
Calculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and
approach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like Big Idea Math.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere are some of the IM‚Äôs shortcomings as a high-school level math textbook in
the context of HGM (especially Algebra 1&2, and Geometry):‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIM covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower
knowledge base due to its slower pace. It does not delve deep enough into
materials, compared to Big Ideas Math and other common core math textbooks. It
offers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts, which
bores and even confuses students.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIM lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and
seems to be a 'watered-down' version of traditional math textbooks.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIM‚Äôs approach does not align with that of college textbooks.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIM doesn't offer enough texts, guidelines, and exercises after each
lesson/chapter for students to further their investigation and study after
school.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúIM‚Äôs lesson/chapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard
mathematical terms, equations, theorems, and conventions that are essential for
a smooth transition to future courses such as Calculus and Physics.‚Äù ‚Ä¶

- ‚ÄúWe have math teachers at HGM who are highly skilled in using Big Idea Math.
Having them switch to a very different and possibly inferior way of teaching
seems to be a huge waste of their talent and expertise.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúBecause of the deficiency of the IM textbook and curriculum, some HGM parents
are compelled to seek outside help and tutoring, which adds extra and
unnecessary workload and burden to students and parents at home.‚Äù

‚ÄúOverall, I believe that whilst IM may be a suitable choice for the general
student population, it is unfortunately an inadequate and unsuitable selection
for the HGM students.‚Äù
(End of excerpted letter)

Here, the critique of Illustrative Math can be extrapolated and applied to the
general shape of the math curriculum put forth in the new CMF, as the underlying
principles and techniques are similar to those outlined in the first several
chapters of the CMF.

In two separate schools in two separate examples, our family discovered that new
progressive math curriculum aligned with the CMF was woefully inadequate when it
came to addressing the specific set of learning needs of high achievers. Nor did
it adequately prepare students for college level math. The slow pace and the
repetition of the more progressive math models (which circle back again and
again) temporarily killed the fast learners‚Äô love of math.

At scale, the proposed CMF recommendations will potentially violate state law by
making high achievers repeat classes and concepts they have already mastered.
Those learners deserve to experience growth within their Zones of Proximal
Development. Further, despite the CMF throwing out decades of research re:
gifted learners (by asserting that there is no such thing ‚Äì it‚Äôs all a growth
mindset) these learners require appropriate placement as guaranteed by the Math
Placement Act to support their academic growth.

All this said, the population of learners who needs the most help with math in
CA is not the group of outliers at the top. The CMF is rightly concerned with
the math achievement gap between various ethnic, racial, and cultural groups.

However, this is also where the proposed CMF is at its most cynical. For a
document that is primarily concerned with equity, the authors of the CMF do not
offer solid data and peer-reviewed research to support their hypothesis that
their drastic overhaul to math education in CA will actually make anything more
equitable for those who need it most.
In previous drafts of the CMF, the authors cited San Francisco Unified School
District‚Äôs ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù with de-tracking Algebra in 2014 as proof that their
approach to revamping K-12 math worked. When new information re: SFUSD‚Äôs program
surfaced, the available data did not support that claim. In fact, it now appears
that SFUSD‚Äôs de-tracking experiment was a disaster, further exacerbating the
math achievement gap for black and Latinx students. The only way students could
prepare for the accelerated classes in high school was to take expensive
supplemental math outside of their public schools as a workaround.
Economically-disadvantaged kids continued to be the ones least likely to take
the private classes. (See: ‚ÄúSFUSD's delay of algebra 1 has created a nightmare
of workarounds‚Äù by Rex Ridgeway, San Francisco Examiner, March 8, 2023)
While SFUSD‚Äôs failed math experiment has been removed from this draft of the
CMF, the model that drove SFUSD‚Äôs failure remains the proposed math model of
choice for the California Board of Education. Why? What data supports the
authors‚Äô hypothesis without hard facts to back it?
The CMF authors‚Äô biggest argument against traditional math is that it
perpetuates inequity via tracking. Their solution is to remove accelerated
classes and de-track, but they wind up proposing a whole new track (data
science) that will heartlessly trap kids who were hoping to enter STEM majors in
college into a new dead end.
As Brian Conrad of Stanford has explained at length, when students take data
science as an alternative to the pre-requisite they actually need, calculus, the
effect will be to kill their STEM careers before they start. How is taking
accelerated math in middle school a problem, but encouraging kids to pursue an
entirely new data science track for the entirety of their high school career
that may or may not meet UC standards for advanced math ‚Äì that may bar them from
STEM majors - not a dirty trick? Here, the BOE must consider the following
article just printed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, ‚ÄúThe University of
California Changed Its Math Standards. Some Faculty Aren‚Äôt Happy‚Äù by Stephanie
M. Lee, 7/6/23. The article backs up Conrad‚Äôs many critiques of Chapter 5 of the
CMF. The inequity and issues that the data science track poses must be addressed
before moving forward.
The problem with ‚Äútracking,‚Äù after all, is getting stuck on a track. However,
when tracks are turned into pathways with many entryways, students can learn at
an appropriate pace with a similar ability group (a much needed grouping in
large public schools). They can even level-up to a new group without the
curriculum getting dumbed-down into a ‚Äúone sized fits all model.‚Äù Why was this
solution not considered? Why is the de-tracking model used in SFUSD still in the
CMF (without the accompanying data showing it didn‚Äôt work) when math models like
those employed in the Long Beach Unified School District ‚Äì where kids can be
taught on different pathways that they can leave and enter - have actually
proven to deliver more equitable results?

Finally, the authors of the CMF have targeted anyone raising questions about
their data, methods, and models as politically-motivated. In Chapter 9, the
authors assert re: the Common Core adoption of 2001 that, ‚ÄúThe most organized
resistance came from politically-affiliated groups who resist equitable change
(see for example, Evers, 2021). More recently, the changes proposed for the
California Math Framework have been met with similar opposition.‚Äù Like many big
sweeping statements, this last assertion is not backed by a peer-reviewed study.
It does not take into account the letter to the BOE signed by over 1,1000 STEM
professionals ‚Äì or the valid critiques (still unaddressed) that came from the
head of undergraduate math at Stanford, Brian Conrad. It is instead a link to a
YouCubed blog post.

And here is the most pressing issue. The BOE must reject any references in this
current framework that do not hold up under scrutiny. There should be no
non-academic research included in the CMF. Non peer-reviewed papers have no
standards. They have no business being used as references for a math framework
designed to change the schooling of millions of students. Blog posts and opinion
pieces must be removed for the CMF to have any credulity as an academic
document. The many references to YouCubed and the CMF authors‚Äô commercial
concerns must be removed. (Given the sheer amount of new textbooks that will be
required by the new CMF, it is a massive conflict of interest to make this
document an infomercial for the YouCubed group.)

The new revised CMF still reads as an aspirational document. It is a massive
hypothesis without the peer-reviewed data to back up its assertions. While it
has been clear for some time that the CMF math models do not work for the
fastest learners, the CMF will more gravely change math for all children in the
state in the name of equity, with no proof that its methods and models are able
to deliver equitable results for students who are at the most risk of being
sidelined in math.

As a parent stakeholder whose family has been the test case for this big ideas
and concepts aligned with this math model, I urge you to vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on adopting
the revised CMF. Thank you.

opportunity for students to develop mathematical thinking and problem solving.
Current neuroscience research shows that all students have the ability to learn
and grow given strong instruction and learning opportunities. The way this
framework is set up gives teachers the ability to provide students of diverse
skill and backgrounds entry points for learning and no limits to their learning
trajectory. As an educator, I want students to be able to come into the
classroom and meet their needs. It moves away from the outdated ideas that only
certain students are ‚Äúmath gifted‚Äù or have ‚Äúmath brains‚Äù. This is an important
way for Califorina to invest in all of our students - by seeing the potential in
each of them. Empowering students with the mathematical thinking and analytical
skills will create stronger individuals who are ready for college, careers, and
community engagement. Even if students do not pursue a STEM career, they would
be able to use concepts to do data analysis, problem solving, and critical
thinking in professional and personal environments.

There is skepticism about ‚Äúdetracking‚Äù students and whether this will diminish
students ability to excel in a diverse classroom. However, math can be
multidimensional and creative in its approach without diminishing rigor.
Teachers have long differentiated instruction to meet student needs. If students
are in a diverse classroom, they all benefit from the divergent thinking and
approaches to math. They will be able to learn from one another and the multiple
perspectives that are in the classroom. There are no limits in learning. Using
this framework, classrooms could also become more collaborative, inquiry based,
and engaging. Students who are more engaged in classes are more likely to stay
on task and reach learning objectives.

This framework is a foundation for schools to launch academic programs and
instruction that will meet the current needs of our student population. It is an
investment in our future that will support our state and nation because it
empowers a new generation of learners, thinkers, and creators.

tracks, specifically algebra in middle school and pre-calculus + calculus in
high school, were essential preparation for me when I enrolled in my core
undergraduate math courses. Even with a strong foundation, it was challenging to
keep up with peers as we quickly moved through matrix algebra, integral +
differential calculus, and statistics in our first year. This mathematical
training was foundational for our future careers; I am currently at a materials
company developing next generation components for lithium ion batteries. I can
directly trace how my mathematics training supported my decision to enter a STEM
field, and to participate in an innovative business located here in California.

It's not fair or equitable to take away accelerated math tracks from public
school students. By watering down or eliminating accelerated math tracks in
California public schools, the current framework makes it difficult for our
students to thrive in STEM careers. In fact, I'm concerned it will exacerbate
inequality, making it harder for our public school students to access advanced
math training.

Please consider placing additional emphasis on accelerated or honors classes in
the adopted math framework. Instructors such as Professor Conrad at Stanford
University have provided more specific recommendations on ways to improve the
current framework; I'd encourage the Board to adopt them:

Moses Charikar,,moses@cs.stanford.edu,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I completely agree with Mike Lawler's comments on the CMF. He said:

The prior drafts of the CMF had serious problems with accurate and appropriate
references. Claims that have been removed from prior drafts include:
(i) The repeat rate in San Francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to
9th grade fell from 40% to 8%, and
(ii) Most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math.

Problems with references continue with this draft. My recommendation is that all
references that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either
removed or replaced with proper references. If they cannot be replaced, the
items in the CMF that depend on the nonacademic references need to be removed,
too. I'll provide two examples of non-academic references below that should be
removed, but these are just two examples to make the point clear. All of the
non-academic references need to be examined carefully by the California
Department of Education.

For example, the Boaler, Munson, and Williams reference from Youcubed - What is
Mathematical Beauty- is not academic research and ends with an advertisement for
books written by the authors. As Boaler is also an author of the CMF, having a
reference advertising her books included in the CMF is inappropriate.

A second example is the Boaler and Foster paper on Youcubed - Raisin~
Expectations and Achievement. Again, this is not academic research. The paper
has a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the CMF as political. It
is inappropriate to have a reference in the CMF criticizing opposition to the
CMF. This paper also discusses a study - referred to as 'study 2' in the paper -
that compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015. This
comparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student
achievement from a score difference on an Algebra II test one year and an 8th
grade math test in the next year. This reference to the study in this paper in
Chapter 9 of the CMF goes even farther to state (without reference or
explanation) that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling.

The claims about 'study 2' in chapter 9 of the CMF are an example of important
claims in the CMF (in this case, tracking) that are not backed by published
academic research. Again, this reference - and all non-academic research cited
in the CMF - needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic
research. As this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015, there
has been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores. If the only
discussion of these exam scores is the post on Youcubed, this reference and the
discussion about tracking supported by it, needs to be removed.

There are millions of students in California whose lives will be affected by the
CMF It is the responsibility of the California Department of Education to ensure
that the Ideas In the document are supported properly. Non academic work like
blog posts, books, or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as
academic work. The inclusion of advertisements and political statements about
opposition are obviously not appropriate references. Non-academic studies cannot
be central to the CMF's proposal either.

Once the references are corrected (or the material removed), what remains in the
CMF can be evaluated properly.",SBECOMMENT-20230707-101300,7/7/2023 10:13 AM,,,,

The leadership team at Loyola Marymount University‚Äôs Center for Equity for
English Learners extends its appreciation for the diligent work and efforts of
the committee and the writers responsible for the revision of the Mathematics
Framework. We commend the Instructional Quality Commission and members of the
CFCC for drafting a Framework that centers equity and engagement in California‚Äôs
vision of excellence in mathematics education.

We are writing regarding Agenda Item 11: Adoption of the 2023 CA Mathematics
Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve

The Math Framework is a critical resource that can provide guidance on
mathematics instruction centered around equity and access, including the
specific needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students in California.

During the last review cycles, CEEL has partnered with several organizations to
lead advocacy efforts for equity and access in our joint focus on English
Learners. As such, CEEL co-signed letters submitted by Californians Together and
other organizations. Collectively, we have included comments and suggestions to
recommend that chapters incorporate relevant pedagogical practices framed within
principles of equity and access for English Learners and traditionally
marginalized groups of students.

Our goal has been to ensure that the revised Mathematics Framework provides
guidance to ensure greater rigor, relevance, and access for all of California‚Äôs
students, with a particular focus on the students who are most underserved in
mathematics.

Teachers need high-quality instructional guidance, support, and materials now,
to engage all students effectively and equitably in mathematics learning. We
respectfully encourage the SBE to continue moving forward in the recommendation
of revisions that deepen and strengthen the explicit equity focus in support of
all learners including Multilingual/English Learners.

Therefore, we urge the State Board of Education to consider the recommendations
included in the attached document and to adopt the revised framework at its July
2023 meeting so that the instructional materials adoption process can commence
and so that teachers and school leaders can begin to learn about and implement
the framework.

Attached, we respectfully include the LMU-CEEL‚Äôs statement to the CA SBE. We
continue to offer our support and respectfully reaffirm our comments and
suggestions focused on key recommendations for chapters 2, 12, and 13.

Sugi Sorensen,,sugi@allegromedia.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I write in opposition of the third field review of the California
Mathematics Framework (CMF). While the third draft of the CMF shows some
improvement over the second field review, primarily the removal of the
Mathematics: Investigating and Connecting (MIC) pathway as a third proposed
pathway in chapter 8, the overall document retains too many of the problems
present in the first and second drafts to be salvageable.

As to the issues that persist with the third field review of the CMF that make
it unsalvageable:

- While acknowledging the failings of California's public schools on the whole
in providing minimal mathematics instruction to its students, the CMF merely
asserts that the solution is to adopt the CMF writers' preferred instructional
approaches. There is a large body of research and experience that indicates
alternative approaches would better close math achievement gaps and improve
mathematics instruction.

- The lead writer of the CMF writing team -- Jo Boaler -- had a conflict of
interest because much of the 'research' cited to support the authors' claims,
particularly with regard to detracking, as well as approaches recommended come
from her own for-profit organization - YouCubed.org
[https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://YouCubed.org__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!ffOThZtjZ6QKlo8imzM6BLCiFJTgsaLW8bRZnpL2UlGfHdQ7QYC-z4W7eWJEyUelAkb_Z02jSXxU8242aDc$].
Boaler earns substantial income consulting with CA public school districts
advising on mathematics curricular changes.

- The CMF is an overly political document that focuses on equity from the first
chapter. Chapter 1 states, 'Reflecting the state‚Äôs commitment to equity, every
chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to
help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.'
Two entire chapters -- 2 and 9 -- are devoted exclusively to equity as the
authors define it. That understanding of 'equity' can be gleaned from the
Glossary in chapter 14 of the CMF:

'Equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness. Drawing from
Gutierrez (2012), equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1)
Access to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes
and success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4)
Attention to relations of power.'

The third and fourth dimensions of 'equity' are by the author's own admission in
her 2012 paper rooted in critical theory. A curriculum framework should not
contain a political orientation or political recommendations.

- The instructional recommendations recommended in the CMF are poorly supported,
ignore research that supports competing recommendations, and are often justified
by dubious research or questionable summarizations of the research cited. This
is tacitly acknowledged by the WestEd researchers hired to write the third field
review as they removed references to San Francisco Unified School District's
failed policy of delaying Algebra 1 to 9th grade, yet claims continue to be made
based on those references.

- If the instructional and policy recommendations in the CMF are followed by
California school district's, it is my informed opinion that California K-12
students' achievements in mathematics will continue to decline. The first
chapter of the CMF says it is 'centered around the investigation of big ideas in
mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and
taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs.' This focus on
big ideas, connection to 'authentic' student contexts, and vague notions of
'multidimensional ways' rooted in UDL will necessarily reduce instructional time
in development of basic mathematical skills.",SBECOMMENT-20230707-102027,7/7/2023 10:20 AM,,,,

Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. I completely agree with
Tom Loveless' comments on the revised draft of the CMF. He said:

I write this letter to oppose the proposed California Math Framework. My
comments are a distillation of a lengthier analysis presented in the Spring 2023
issue of Education Next, 'California's New Math Framework Doesn't Add Up.'

The framework‚Äôs stated purpose is ‚Äúto support implementation of the California
Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM).‚Äù The framework
undermines the standards, in some cases directly contradicting them.

The framework states: ‚ÄúAttaining fluency with multiplication and division within
100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students‚Äô work.‚Äù How
can that be? If students know multiplication facts ‚Äúfrom memory‚Äù at the end of
third grade‚Äîas stipulated in the state standards--why would they still be
working on basic fact fluency in the upper elementary grades? But the claim is
repeated: ‚ÄúAcquiring fluency with multiplication facts begins in third grade and
development continues in grades four and five.‚Äù (pg. 83)

Note that California‚Äôs 2013 math framework contained almost the exact same
wording to describe third grade expectations. ‚ÄúMultiplication and division are
new concepts in grade three, and reaching fluency with these operations within
100 represents a major portion of students‚Äô work. By the end of grade three,
students also know all products of two one-digit numbers from memory (3.OA.7 ).‚Äù
A major portion of 3rd grade work will now become a major portion of the work in
upper elementary grades. What a step backwards!

What does fluent mean? The 2013 framework offers a clear definition, consistent
with other states that adopted Common Core. ‚ÄúThe word fluent is used in the
standards to mean ‚Äòreasonably fast and accurate‚Äô and possessing the ability to
use certain facts and procedures with enough facility that using such knowledge
does not slow down or derail the problem solver as he or she works on more
complex problems.‚Äù The new framework redefines fluency to discourage an emphasis
on speed.

The California Common Core Math Standards call for students to demonstrate an
understanding of, and the ability to use, the standard algorithms of addition
and subtraction by the end of fourth grade, multiplication by the end of fifth
grade, and division by the end of sixth grade. These are culminating standards,
not ironclad rules regarding when standard algorithms can and cannot be taught.

The proposed math framework interprets these standards as banning the teaching
of standard algorithms before the culminating grade, a false interpretation
explicitly debunked by Jason Zimba, one of the Common Core co-authors. If this
framework is adopted, California‚Äôs students will encounter the standard division
algorithm for the first time in sixth grade, years after most of the world has
attained mastery.

Please reject the proposed framework.

Where is the clear and accessible path to completing foundational math and

My district, San Francisco Unified (SFUSD), struggled with implementing Common
Core Math and providing easily accessible pathways to the foundational math

an ‚Äúantithetical‚Äù compression course pathway.

Make no mistake: those with resources found workarounds to SFUSD‚Äôs pathways and
will find workarounds to this Framework. I‚Äôm writing on behalf of those with

The Framework needs to identify a clear and accessible path for all students

opportunities to encounter deep, connected mathematics. As a member of the team
of writers hired to help the CFCC put ideas into language, I got a good
appreciation for the thought and care that went into the emphases they chose for
the Framework.

The proposed Framework represents an excellent step forward, as we learn from 13
years of experience with the California Common Core Standards in Mathematics.
Focusing instruction around the standards' big ideas, and helping students
experience math from a place of curiosity and connection, will go a long way
towards substantially increasing the group of students who enter college as

I am also a father of one deeply committed to public education. The stated goals
of the new math framework are laudable, but the methods will frankly not achieve
those goals, and in the process will irreparably harm the schooling of millions
of Californian public school children. Tens or hundreds of thousands more will
be driven away from the public school system, leaving those who remain in public
schools even further behind.

Dr. Boaler's work is the bedrock of this framework. She is cited 28 times, more
than any other but the CA DoE itself, and 4x more than any other single human
author. To rely so heavily on the work of a Nobel Laureate would be
questionable; to do so for an author whose work is so highly controversial is

School District Organization ...",Support,"We are in a unique situation that isolates us from our neighbors &
our community. The school district boundary divides a block of 4 homes into 2.
The boundary is not a cross street/end of a street, but a fence dividing
neighbors from each other.Fences are meant as property lines not isolating
children from those a few doors down.

Our children are growing up in the OGSD Community as their
neighborhood/community. This is where we live and interact. COVID years were
very tough on everyone but particularly difficult on young children. Our
children went through significant anxiety issues. Being forced to go to the
assigned schools of SJUSD would only make psychological issues worse.The
assigned schools are located within 3 separate communities, none of which are
walkable and would remove the children from their neighborhood peers & friends.

The interdistrict transfer process is there but it is inconsistent, unreliable
and leads to uncertainty as:
1.The transfer process is a criteria based annual application with no guarantee
of admission year to year. Our eligibility criteria is employment based and is
only valid for children K-5, with no established criteria for gr 6-12 &
employment is never guaranteed. How do we plan for 6-12?
2. The application status is unknown until June & July making it impossible to
plan for after school care/activity, as this enrollment happens prior to June.
3. Transfer students are at a disadvantage.They fail to meet resident criteria
for any special district programs because they will only be considered after
resident students.

Our application meets all the 9 technical criteria for a territory transfer and
was supported by the SCC Office of Education.It

would be unfair and disheartening to base a decision without considering all the
variables that have changed since the boundary was created.

Having familiarity with their surroundings & community provides children a safe
space.Student & parent involvement occurs naturally and spontaneously when you
reside within the same community as your schools.It

would be devastating if this was taken away.We would never be able to feel the
same connection with any of the allocated schools as they are not a part of the
neighborhood in which we reside & are located within 3 separate communities.We
ask for certainty, consistency, and reliability. We should not be discriminated
against because of which side of the fence our property lies.

We are asking that children and their best interest be prioritized, and the
politics of outdated boundaries not interfere with what is right for children
growing up within the OGSD & ESUHSD neighborhood.If approved, all 3 of the
schools we would attend, without any uncertainty, would be within walking
distance on safe neighborhood streets.

We hope you take this unique & bizarre boundary situation passing through the
middle of our homes into account when making your decision. Please allow these
children to continue thriving in the community where they reside.

acceptance is meticulously dependent on grades???? How is that good for mental
health? How does that protect against math anxiety??? We need students to be
allowed to accelerate in middle school when grades don't matter and they can
find themselves and experiment. The approach to acceleration in this CMF is
devastating to anyone not in private schools (paying 50-60K/year) or who does
not provide external tutoring and classes for students to compensate for this
terrible public math education. The idea that restricting acceleration in math
to high school to reach Advanced Placement Calculus in this CMF is HORRIBLE for
mental health! During high school, students who did NOT get external tutoring in
middle school will be compared to kids who did. In our district in Palo Alto
many parents (including school board members) send their kids to private school
during middle school when that delaning experiment was implemented just before
the pandemic. Then they come back with all their enrichment and are compared to
the parents who trusted public education to prepare their kids. Students also
receive a lot of pressure to down-lane. It's destructive. Competition to get
into college engineering programs is FIERCE and anyone who doesn't have AP
calculus in high school has no chance, particularly if they don't have straight
A's and 5's on their AP Calculus exam. The Data Science class is a pathway to a
dead end and a signal to colleges that this student is not serious about STEM
and yet this CMF emphasizes it. It's like a prize for participation designed to
make students feel good but everyone knows it is useless. Get a STEM
professional and a math professor like Brian Conrad on this writing team and
LISTEN to what he says!!! Or go back to the 2013 Framework. Students are not
widgets. They are individuals and need to be placed in classrooms that are right
for what they need, not in some heterogeneous class that serves no one. Families
need to be respected and told the truth about what successful preparation for
STEM is. Stop sending us the useless CMF once and for all and throw this CMF

The Carlsbad Education Alliance (CEA) is a coalition of parents, students and
staff in the Carlsbad Unified School District committed to transparency,
accountability and academic excellence. CEA opposes the new Mathematics
Framework developed by the California Department of Education (CDE),
Instructional Quality Commission (IQC), and State Board of Education (SBE). The
CDE website states that this framework will provide ‚Äú...guidance designed to
help educators align classroom teaching with California‚Äôs rigorous math learning
standards.‚Äù Yet, the rigorous standards referred to by the CDE have failed to
produce passing scores on national standardized math tests taken by California
students, and California continues to rank in the bottom quartile. Additionally,
on California‚Äôs own Smarter Balanced state assessment, only 33% of students met
or exceeded math proficiency standards last year. This is a failure on every
level for California‚Äôs students.

The newly proposed Mathematics Framework should focus solely on teaching math.
Time and instruction on side issues like identity, equity and social justice do
not have a place in California‚Äôs failing math curriculum. Those topics will not
improve scores on state-wide and nation-wide standardized tests. As educators,
it is your job to advise and implement instruction based on proven techniques
and facts, not theories and ideologies that are untested and unproven in
reputable journals or publications.

We urge you to do better for California‚Äôs students. Reject any and all
components of the framework that do not solely contribute to creating a
curriculum that will enable the majority of our students to pass standardized
state and national tests. It‚Äôs quite simple. Just teach math.

Seeing that 'data science' is advocated in the CMF as replacing Algebra 2, as a
practicing engineer (I invented Shazam), I use Algebra 2 concepts EVERY DAY.
They are fundamental to engineering. I am baffled by public comments, videos,
and publications in which Boaler disparages Algebra 2 as 'outdated'. In a video,
she specifically derides synthetic division. Synthetic division is used in
infinite impulse response recursive filters in almost EVERY modern digital
signal processing device. This includes speakers, microphones, AirPods, smart
phones, WiFi, cable data, and more. Abstract forms of it are used in encryption
and error correcting codes. They are computed millions of times per second, in
your hands, ears, car, etc. Every time you use AirPods, drive a modern car, make
a phone call, send an email, think of synthetic division. It is irresponsible to
downplay the extremely relevant and fundamental set of mathematical techniques
and tools whose fundamentals are taught in Algebra 2. If anything, the use and
reliance of modern technology on Algebra 2 is increasing. It is not outdated. It
is even fun: synthetically divide 1/(x^2-x-1) and you get the Fibonacci series.

How can the CDE, an agency entrusted with ensuring that CA and the USA, be
advocating a dead-end path to competitiveness in a world-wide market for
engineers? In Silicon Valley, we hire engineers and scientists from other
countries because we have a shortage of STEM-trained students. At Stanford, in
the physics department, an observation was that US-born and very smart physics
majors had to drop out of the program because they did not have enough math
preparation vs their foreign peers.

A very recent article in the Chronicles of Higher Education suggests that the
Data Science approval as satisfying a UC(c) requirement might be retracted:
'Now, some members appear to be rethinking it. At BOARS committee meetings in
March and April, representatives for the Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles,
Merced, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz campuses all voiced concerns
about math preparation, minutes show. At one point, ‚Äúmembers suggested that the
previous BOARS‚Äô decision may have been rushed.‚Äù
A group of Black UC faculty members in data science-related fields sent a letter
to the committee in May. ‚ÄúIntroduction to Data Science‚Äù and courses like it,
they wrote, ‚Äúmake claims that they specifically support learning for women and
minorities, which are not only baseless, but fail to appreciate that they
actually do the opposite and harm students from such groups by steering them
away from being prepared for STEM majors.‚Äù And the chair of Santa Barbara‚Äôs
mechanical-engineering department wrote to express ‚Äúour strongest support for
keeping Algebra 2 as a core requirement,‚Äù as it ‚Äúteaches concepts which are
absolutely essential for our undergraduate students to succeed in our program.‚Äù

Please do not ram this through for approval. It is irresponsible to further
weaken our students' competitiveness on a worldwide market for talent.

Lisa Fittery,,lfittery@att.net,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose," Dear California State Board of Education,
I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)
proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in
math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or
advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF
Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have
also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down
from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced
in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California‚Äôs plans to remedy
this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such
as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with
students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math.
A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this
math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping
kids feel good about math. The word ‚Äúidentity‚Äù (in reference to building up
students‚Äô math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times.
The word ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math
community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students
achieve math ‚Äúproficiency‚Äù is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is
against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a
consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the
primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the
over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math
content proficiency.
‚óè ‚ÄúThis framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for
students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and
feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community.‚Äù (Ch. 2, Line 192)
‚óè ‚ÄúBoth mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that
teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students‚Äô
perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics
thinkers.‚Äù (Ch. 2, Line 462)
‚óè ‚ÄúThis concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at
the pre-kindergarten level.‚Äù (Ch 2, Line 467)
‚óè ‚ÄúTeaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students‚Äô
backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense
of belonging.‚Äù (Ch 2, Line 499)
‚óè ‚ÄúTeachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share
autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for
students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences.‚Äù
(Ch 2, Line 514)
1

‚óè ‚ÄúThey strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community.‚Äù
(Ch 2, Line 792)
‚óè ‚ÄúA classroom that welcomes students‚Äô unfinished thinking normalizes
mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as
belonging to the discipline of mathematics.‚Äù (Ch 2, Line 871)
‚óè ‚ÄúThe aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is
about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong.‚Äù (Ch
2, Line 988)
‚óè ‚ÄúData investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of
belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely
relevant to their lives.‚Äù (Ch 5, Line 123)
‚óè ‚ÄúEducators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing
engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with
content.‚Äù (Ch 5, Line 1400)
‚óè ‚ÄúImportant principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer
the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the
following:
‚óã Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages.‚Äù (Ch 5, Line 1409)
‚óè ‚ÄúThis framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences
of all
their students are positive ‚Äù(Ch 7 Line 68)
‚óè ‚ÄúThe idea is for teachers to help students experience the ‚Äúwonder, joy, and
beauty of math‚Äù (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students
develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners.‚Äù (Ch 7,
Line 72)
‚óè ‚ÄúWhen students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can
come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more
positively.‚Äù (Ch 2 line 164)
All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math
positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a
state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency,
even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The
CMF advises teachers, ‚ÄúDuring groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to
elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group,
which is referred to as ‚Äúassigning competence‚Äù. (Ch 12, line 244) What
California needs is not ‚Äúassigned competence‚Äù but ‚Äúactual competence‚Äù which is
often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to
learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, ‚ÄúWhen teachers perceive that a
student has become ‚Äúlow status‚Äù in a group, they intervene by publicly praising
a mathematical contribution the student has made.‚Äù (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot
nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a
nice takeoff? Status
2

is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected,
not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past.
The CMF continues in this vein, writing ‚Äúbut grouping by perceived ‚Äúability‚Äù can
be the first step in a system of tracking if ‚Äúsimilar ability‚Äù students are
grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs
about who is capable‚Äîas when groups are intentionally stratified according to
perceived ‚Äúability‚Äù so that students soon understand who is the ‚Äúhigh kid‚Äù and
who is the ‚Äúlow kid‚Äù in the group. Aside from language development
considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey
to each student that everyone has something to offer the group‚Äôs learning and
something to learn from the thoughts of others.‚Äù (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know
who the ‚Äúhigh kids‚Äù are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special
group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the
authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners‚Äô
acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of
course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most
capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient;
everyone knows that! Let‚Äôs not hide that and pretend all students are on equal
footing; rather, let‚Äôs put struggling students into groups and provide extra
support so they CAN become proficient.
In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of
achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious
as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence)
‚ÄúStudents also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the
memorization of meaningless formulas‚Äîperhaps because they see no relevance for
their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning
mathematics.‚Äù (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn‚Äôt it possible that some self-select out of
math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students
self-select out of (even if it‚Äôs fun and engaging), such as little league, boy
scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, ‚ÄúOther research examines
beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant
to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe
drop off in utility value during high school.‚Äù (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many
things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what
happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and
perhaps you‚Äôll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students
don‚Äôt care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the
math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life.
The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what
students MUST learn, whether or not they see ‚Äúutility‚Äù in it. The same is true
in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF
needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so
concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of
math education- to learn math!
In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem,
the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12
Line 854 reads, ‚ÄúSummative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing
for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging
effects.‚Äù Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is
the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are
3

not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say
or do at all so they feel good about themselves?
California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency,
especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need
of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students‚Äô math proficiency levels;
rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more
concerned with how students feel about math, helping them ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to the math

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Support,"As a current mathematics teacher in CA public schools, and a former
student in the CA public education system, I am writing to express my support
for the proposed California Math Framework. The framework provides appropriate
guidance for districts, schools, and teachers to implement the common core
standards for mathematics, placing a focus on diversity, equity, and deep
understanding of mathematics.
I am aware of numerous criticisms of the framework, and would like to speak to a
few of these criticisms and why I believe they should be taken with a grain of
salt when considering the goals for the future of California mathematics
education. Firstly, many criticisms rely on analysis and criticisms written by
Brian Conrad of the Stanford Mathematics Department. I attended Stanford
University as an undergraduate in the late 2010s. During my time at Stanford,
Conrad was a professor and director of undergraduate studies. Unfortunately, my
experience with mathematics at Stanford revealed that the Stanford Math
Department has no interest in increasing diversity, equity, or deep
understanding of mathematics. I entered my freshman year as a high achieving
math student, excited about mathematics and potentially interested in a major,
but my first day of class made me feel alienated, incompetent, and discouraged.
Not because I was truly unqualified, but because the professor made it clear
that asking questions would be interpreted as stupidity, that he expected the
majority of us to fail the class, and that mathematics was an elite field meant
only for some. Throughout my first year, I learned more about the math
department that only supported these initial impressions -- particularly that
there were nearly no faculty or lecturers who were women or people of color, and
that the department building had only recently installed its first women's
restroom. I chose to major in chemistry instead of mathematics so that I could
continue exploring advanced mathematical ideas, but apart from the mathematics
department. I still maintain that had I attended a different university, I would
have likely majored in mathematics, but Stanford was not a welcoming place to do
so. I bring my experience to your attention in order to underscore that though
Brian Conrad may have interest in the subject, he has little to no authority to
speak on mathematics education, and within his own field of influence, he has
been a part of creating a space that is antithetical to the goals of the CA math
framework. I am sure that we do not want CA students to feel alienated,
incompetent, and discouraged when experiencing math class, and I feel that the
math framework would allow us to move in a positive direction.
Another criticism of the framework relates to the framework's advice on limiting
tracking and acceleration in mathematics. As both a teacher and mathematics
student who experienced acceleration, I can speak to the extreme negative
effects it can have, not only creating significant gaps in understanding, but
also causing students to 'burn out' on math, instead of fostering a love and joy
that can last throughout college and career. Specifically, some criticisms argue
that advice against acceleration are holding students back, and that prior to
common core, all students used to take algebra in 8th grade, but now that is
pushed to high school. I personally took 'algebra' in 8th grade under the
standards preceding common core, and much of the 8th grade math curriculum under
common core matches up with what was taught in 'algebra.' By contrast, the high
school Algebra curriculum under common core is much more rigorous and requires
much deeper understanding and fluency of connections between ideas than what was
previously accepted. It is important for us as educators to focus on ensuring
students have strong, interconnected and flexible understandings of mathematics
- this is unfortunately lost when we allow for rampant acceleration. Because of
this, I appreciate the framework's advice on limiting acceleration and I am
hopeful for how it will support schools and districts in creating pathways that
prioritize students' deep understanding.
I am thankful for the work that has gone into creating and revising the
Mathematics Framework over the past 3 years. I urge the board to adopt the
framework so that we can move forward into implementing what is best for CA math
students. ",SBECOMMENT-20230707-115038,7/7/2023 11:50 AM,,,,

to bettering the lives of humans and the planet across seventeen (17) areas:
recognizing that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with

economic growth. SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education
and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The State of California has
fallen short with respect to SDG 4 in that many CA school districts, current
teaching practices have resulted in only one-third of students scoring
proficient in math on standardized measures across the state. Additionally, most
students are being pushed out of high-level pathways at a young age. Math
education has been a gatekeeper to college and career success, preventing
first-generation college-bound students, Black and Latino students, students
with disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to 4-year
colleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers. Mathematics instruction
in California must be more effective and equitable. The revisions to the
framework offer a better way to teach mathematics. Methods that are creative,

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"Dear State Board of Education,

I am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposed Mathematics
Framework for California Public Schools and the very short period being provided
for public comment on this version of the framework.

Regarding the comment time, I understand the public is being given less than 2
weeks to comment, with a deadline of noon today--a deadline I'm barely meeting,
even as someone who has done a lot of public-school advocacy the last few years.
Given the short time frame and scheduling of comments during the 4th of July
holiday period, it seems likely that many people who would be interested in
commenting on such a major proposal won't even know about it in time. The CDE
website states that 60-day review periods were provided for comment on prior
versions of the proposal (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/), so why not provide
a similar time frame for review and comment on the latest version?

Regarding the substance of the math framework, I am concerned that it is based
largely on ideological and personal views about teaching math and equity, rather
than on evidence-based practices and real-world behavior. As a parent of two
kids in SFUSD, we have seen that efforts grounded in ideology, however
well-intentioned, have had harmful results, including in math. Just because you
want something to be true doesn't make it so.

For example, about 10 years ago, SFUSD, noting gaps between groups and the need
for equity, embarked on an ambitious plan to change how math is taught,
including by removing algebra from 8th grade. The results of this experiment? It
was a failure, as SFUSD's Superintendent Matt Wayne has publicly acknowledged.
Indeed, the gaps between groups grew even worse. Many families with more
resources put their kids in private school or found workarounds such as tutoring
and online classes to help their kids in math. And the most disadvantaged kids
got the short end of the stick yet again, with even less opportunity to learn,
to be challenged, and to excel.

What you do--what we choose to do as a society--affects real people. I am very
concerned by the framework's apparent reliance on many of Dr. Jo Boaler's
recommendations, as SFUSD's math overhaul was strongly influenced by Dr.
Boaler's views--and failed. I urge you to rely on evidence-based practices--the
things we know work best--not 'one-size-fits-all' policies and approaches. We
need to try to meet each child where they are at and give them the opportunity
to succeed. We are all different, we all have different strengths and
weaknesses, and we can all benefit from being challenged--wherever we may be
starting from.

I support the adoption of the CA Mathematics Framework 2023. The framework
focuses on -

Integrated and Conceptual Understanding: The framework promotes an integrated
and conceptual understanding of mathematics. Rather than focusing solely on
procedural fluency, it encourages students to develop a deep understanding of
mathematical concepts and connections between different mathematical topics.
This approach helps students develop a solid foundation in math and fosters a
lifelong love for the subject.

Problem-solving and Application: The revised framework encourages students to
engage in problem-solving activities and apply their mathematical knowledge to
real-world situations. Teachers, families, and partners support this aspect as
it helps students see the relevance of math in their everyday lives and equips
them with problem-solving skills that are valuable beyond the classroom.

Collaboration and Communication: The framework emphasizes the importance of
collaboration and communication in learning mathematics. It encourages students
to work in groups, engage in mathematical discourse, and explain their thinking.
This collaborative approach fosters a supportive and inclusive learning
environment and prepares students for future teamwork and communication in
various settings

of opening up the CMF for public comments while in practice it effectively runs
the general public out of time to provide feedback. The current version of the
CMF that the SBE is about to vote on retained and carried over several
substantive flaws from the prior CFM/second field draft. These must be
corrected. Furthermore, CMF has been written under a process fraught with
conflicts of interest. The CDE and SBE should hire external legal counsel to
evaluate this issue to provide clearance and not rely on its internal counsel
that is biased to support internal processes. The current CMF cannot be approved
in its current form and be allowed to influence math public education for 8
years.

The SBE should be up to date on current issues and perform its due diligence
that incorporates research and practical evidence that clearly illustrates that
the current proposals in CMF do not work. For example, CMF references in lines
833-836 chapter 8 that data science is valid due to a UC BOARS policy resolution
on area C (October 2020). Recently, California State University passed an
academic senate resolution rejecting the UC policy (page 4, third full paragraph
in the attached CSU 3599.PDF).

Public education in the state of California is funded by both state and federal
funding. The CDE effectively hired CMF writers employed by the owner of youcubed
trademark ‚ÄìStanford University‚Äôs Graduate School of Education (GSE) department -
that sell teacher training into public schools on data science courses to write
a data science philosophy into the math framework where funding for public
education is coming both from state and federal resources. Organizational
Conflicts of Interest (OCI) in federal contracts requires that contractors who
advise on establishing criteria should not be writing their own criteria into
policies such that they can then turn around and sell their services funded by
taxpayer funds. Yet the CDE and SBE did exactly that. It has been made crystal
clear by 442 California based STEM professors (attached), exclusively from 4
year colleges, INCLUDING 100 Stanford STEM professors (NOT part of Stanford‚Äôs
Graduate School of Education department) that these shallow data science courses
do not adhere to mathematical content standards and that data science is not a
replacement for Algebra II. Dr Jelani Nelson from UC Berkeley and Dr Brian
Conrad from Stanford are high profile advocates of the fact that there should be
a CONTENT STANDARD established for data science. What criteria should be used
for instructional materials? The CDE and SBE have made no efforts to establish
objective criteria. Instead, a select group of collaborators from UCLA and
Stanford‚Äôs GSE during the CMF revision process over the last 3 years have been
given a huge advantage over any competition (see attached emails). Education
policy at the state level should be based on unbiased, academic research.

been revised, I do not see how this Framework will make an effective change to
teaching practice. Any attempt to distill this document down will lead to
misapplications and myth-based instruction. Although there is little use in
playing 'what if', what would have happened if the committee had instead focused
on how to implement research practices that improve achievement in an engaging
way instead of focusing solely on uplifting inquiry as the only way to ensure
active engagement? What if the CMF had been aligned with the IES Practice Guides
for teaching mathematics and provided teachers with evidence-based instructional
strategies and ways to implement them engagingly? Although the Common Core
Standards and SMPs are indisputably important and useful ideas, the lack of a
distilled set of instructional principles (other than telling teachers to always
use rich, authentic tasks and center everything around student ideas) that
teachers can put into practice is frustrating. Based on this revision, it seems
inevitable that the impression that throwing students into authentic tasks is
all that is needed for students to be engaged and learn, and that because
standards are assigned to a grade band, no one teacher is responsible for
ensuring students reach mastery on a concept, skill, or procedure. This,
frankly, is a recipe for continuous unfinished learning that is passed from
grade to grade. In addition, adopting the definition of 'fluency' that removes
the explicit final goal of 'retrieval from memory' is setting up kids for
difficulties, and the very anxiety in higher mathematics that the CFM is
attempting to avoid. There is no question that the push to memorize procedures
without ever teaching concepts was wrong. But the push to eliminate memorization
‚Äì or at least downplay its importance to the extent you see it minimally
mentioned only in an offhand way - is equally problematic. Although I appreciate
the revisions that have so far been made, I do not believe this document is
ready for release. (And frankly, there has hardly been any time at all to read
and comment on this version!!) Others, like Brian Conrad, have pointed out
continued misleading citations to research. And I am continually dismayed by the
focus on inquiry as the primary method of teaching, as well as the continued
denigration of any explicit, systematic instruction as 'passive' and 'lecture'
and ‚Äúlower-level teaching‚Äù. Instead, they set up a false dichotomy between
engagement and explicit instruction, and so it is no wonder the authors want the
assessment processes to change. Based on prior research on the impact of inquiry
on achievement, the results of this Framework‚Äôs implementations are not likely
to be good. ",SBECOMMENT-20230707-120013,7/7/2023 12:00 PM,,,,

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"I am an 18-year-old San Franciscan who is planning on majoring in
mathematics in college.
Ideally, any student who desires to will be able to progress through math at
their maximum possible pace without reaching a maximum class. Single-variable
calculus and statistics are currently framed as the highest goals of high school
mathematics. Intelligent teenagers can and should take such classes as linear
algebra, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. I attended
a private high school for gifted students where these three classes are
considered part of the 'extended math core,' and are highly popular. In order to
have time to complete such courses, students should be allowed to take more
basic classes early and/or at an accelerated pace.
I agree that 'students who specialize in mathematics may also understand that
vectors and matrices are additional objects that can name new types of
quantities and can be manipulated to understand those quantities, using
operations similar (but not identical) to those of real numbers.' Therefore, a
class on linear algebra should be offered.
The truth is that the goal of within-classroom intellectual diversity comes at
the cost of intellectual diversity as a whole. When students are grouped by
ability, gifted students achieve greater outcomes at no cost to less gifted
students. (Card and Giuliano, 2015, write that advanced black and Hispanic
students 'gain 0.5 standard deviation units in fourth-grade reading and math
scores, with persistent gains through sixth grade' when tracking is implemented
in fourth grade, and that they found 'no evidence of either positive or negative
spillover effects on other students in the same school/grade cohort,' a result
echoed in many other studies.) This is desirable because it increases the
overall amount of achievement.
The framework states that 'students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus
took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on
average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of
ninth grade.' This is simply due to a selection effect.
On page 7 of the chapter on middle school, it is unclear how some students will
bring 'experiences, perspectives, and ideas that enrich the classroom for all'
in the context of math class. Math is not related to life experiences other than
very basic ones which are cross-cultural. The only 'experiences, perspectives,
and ideas' that are useful in math class are ones which come from previous,
creative, or quick mathematical thinking.
As simple diagnostic criteria has proven more accurate than subjective clinical
judgements, there should be a systematized and accessible process for students
to be placed into whatever math class matches their knowledge. All students
should be offered an Algebra I or Mathematics I course in eighth grade so that
students from any background, even students in traditionally low-performing
school districts, can have a chance to complete advanced math courses in
college. I agree that schools should 'adjust the high school curriculum instead,
eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do
not need four courses before Calculus,' or at least offer a compressed pathway
as an option. However, providing both early algebra and high school course
compression are desirable, because calculus is not the most advanced math class
that high-performing students should be taking.
I agree that 'if students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics
III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual
pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of
college,' and I am glad that the pathway for data science rather than Algebra II
has been discarded. Students taking a mathematical science degree will be
expected to know calculus. The statement that 'most college-level study in
mathematics will expect considerable familiarity and comfort with manipulating
algebraic expressions and equations and modeling with functions in order to
solve problems and make certain features of functions apparent' is a
considerable understatement.
In Chapter 1, there is a discussion of 'rigor.' The provided definition is 'an
integrated way in which conceptual understanding, strategies for problem-solving
and computation, and applications are learned so that each supports the other.'
I understand that the definition was knowingly altered to provide a simple
reference term to refer to a core concept of the framework... However, 'rigor'
is already a word, and its true definition is related to strictness and
stiffness. It is not about subjective understanding, but about the
unassailability of the logic. Neither does it have to do with strategies, and
neither does it necessarily involve any applications whatsoever. Of course
subjective understanding, useful strategies, and interesting applications are
all necessary for mathematical pedagogy, but it is unclear why they have been
here included under rigor. In fact, I am of the belief that logical rigor should
be taught in school. If students learn how to read and write real proofs, then
they will not only be introduced to higher math, but they will also learn
valuable lessons about critical thinking and argument.
On page 7 of the chapter on data science, it is stated that 'understanding of
linear regression is closely related to understanding of functions and
polynomials.' In fact, the concept of minimization of error which is essential
to the understanding of linear regression is a concept from calculus. As the
framework states, a data science degree requires calculus and linear algebra.
These subjects are essential to the topic, just as geometry is essential to the
understanding of calculus. Then, if the school system wishes to prepare students
for statistical understanding, it should prioritize teaching students calculus
(and linear algebra, if possible) as soon as possible. Much of the framework
aspires to the effective use of visualization and computational tools with
pre-loaded formulas. The productive use of such tools is certainly important,
but it is not mathematics. The practice of formulating questions to be answered
with data is in the purview of science, not math. Teaching this is math class
will take time away from math if it is not being used to illustrate specific
mathematical concepts, or taught only from probabilistic ideas.
I am also concerned about the inclusion of environmental and social concerns in
the math curriculum. Certainly, problems of society and the environment make
reasonable examples of math applications for students. However, having an
explicit goal of teaching EP&Cs in math class will necessarily compete with the
goal of teaching math in math class. I understand that the decision that
environmental education should be interdisciplinary has been made years ago, in
a way unrelated to this framework, but environmental science certainly seems
like a subject which should be taught in a separate science class (which
integrates concepts learned in math class).
The framework suggests that 'rather than seeking only to understand whether
students can accurately demonstrate algorithmic proficiency on a single problem
type, teachers hold a broader view of how students might demonstrate their
mathematical knowledge and understanding.' This seems to be implying that if
students are not able to apply algorithms properly, then teachers should change
their standards and not require the algorithms. What is the purpose of teaching
students math if they are unable to apply algorithms? The truth is that students
do not possess 'mathematical knowledge and understanding' if they cannot solve
math problems. It is true that it is beneficial to allow students to be creative
and exploratory with the algorithms they use, but this is only possible when
base algorithms are understood and built upon. As it says on the next page of
the document, 'all students need to have a range of strategies and approaches
from which to choose in solving problems, including, but not limited to, general
methods, standard algorithms, and procedures.' Therefore, standard algorithms
should be checked for understanding.
I agree with the framework that 'an important aspect of this understanding is to
recognize the power that algorithms bring to problem solving: knowing only
single-digit multiplication and addition facts, it is possible to compute any
sum, difference, or product involving whole numbers or finite decimals.'",SBECOMMENT-20230707-120105,7/7/2023 12:01 PM,,,,
Carlos Machado,California School Boards Association,cmachado@csba.org,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",N/A,"On behalf of the California School Boards Association (CSBA), which
represents nearly 1,000 school district and county boards of education
statewide, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on Item 11, related to the
Mathematics Framework.

Continuing our shared interest in the development of a framework that best
serves the needs of districts and the diverse students each one serves, CSBA
submitted several general and more than 100 specific comments during the last
round of public comment. After carefully reviewing the updated draft, we submit
the following recommendations for the final publication of the framework in
order to help remove barriers to its implementation.

‚Ä¢ There remains a mismatch between the approach to instruction outlined within
the framework and the current conditions in schools. For successful
implementation, the instructional practices outlined within this framework would
require significant new and ongoing investments with resources not currently
available. This is particularly notable in terms of time for planning,
collaboration, and professional learning. All three are associated with
significant fiscal investments. While the provision of the requisite resources
is outside of its scope, the framework should present more detailed guidance for
how to enact it with the constraints most schools face today.

‚Ä¢ While Chapter 13 specifically discusses instructional adoption standards that
incorporate supports for students with disabilities, the framework should
provide more guidance to address the needs of this student population throughout
the document. The changes suggested will require extensive professional
development to help teachers support students with disabilities in conveying
central themes of the framework such as ‚ÄúBig Ideas‚Äù and additional data science
courses. Additionally, vignettes and teaching examples should include
considerations forstudents with disabilities to make math instruction accessible
and support California‚Äôs move towards more inclusive practices.

‚Ä¢ We urge the State Board and CDE to develop resources and tools to help
districts communicate potential changes in pathways. Rather than have 1000
school districts individually attempt to design communication tools for family
engagement and to build a shared understanding of the vision outlined within
this framework, the state can play a vital role in supporting districts from the
start. In recognition of the fact that districts have a range of needs and serve
diverse contexts, CSBA welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with CDE to
provide input into the development of these materials.

We believe these recommendations will help address the challenges that districts
face and expand the opportunities for students to realize the benefits of a rich
K-12 curriculum that includes a robust mathematics curriculum.

CSBA looks forward to working with the State Board of Education as it finalizes
the 2023 framework.

Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"It is hard to disagree with some of the sentiments behind the CMF
like the ideas that all children should be given the chance to succeed in
mathematics, and children from some groups have had systemic obstacles to
success. But there is a logical leap from these worthy points to the CMF's
recommended interventions like detracking. While all children have potential,
anyone who has taken a math class or works in a technical field knows that there
is also such a thing as innate mathematical ability and it is not equally
distributed in the population. Eliminating advanced classes, tracking, and
selection tests removes the ability to assign children to material appropriate
to their ability and current proficiency, and especially harms the highest
achieving kids who are no longer challenged and stimulated in class.
Much of the research that the CMF is based on and cites has weak quality. For
instance, the non-peer reviewed paper 'Raising Expectations and Achievement: The
Impact of Two Wide Scale De-Tracking Mathematics Reforms' by Boaler and Foster.
Study 2 claims a benefit from an intervention in test scores by comparing scores
on various tests in the pre-implementation year to a different test in the
implementation year, which makes no sense statistically.
By contrast, the most rigorous study of tracking, a randomized controlled trial
led by Esther Duflo who later won the Nobel Prize, found a benefit to tracking
among both the low- and high-achieving children (Peer Effects, Teacher

Math builds on itself so that without assuring mastery of each topic students are unprepared, thus PROFICIENCY must be the goal, not just ‚Äúenhancing learning‚Äù, or ‚Äúpositive mathematics identities‚Äù. Standardized tests are most effective at evaluating proficiency.  To supplement these tests some measures allow for after the formal assessment on can ‚Äútest limits‚Äù, deviating from standard procedures gathering qualitative observations such as those described as ‚Äúformative assessment‚Äù. 

There is an entire chapter of over 60 pages on Assessment and no where is there a mention of modern test standards that are based on rigorous psychometric data including norms, reliability, and validity testing.  Specifically, no where is there any reference to the term test validity, the concept that assessments must have some evidence that they measure the underlying concept they purport to measure.  For example, one would expect a score on a test of Advanced Placement Calculus to predict whether students could solve Calculus problems in different college level tests or for their score on the test to be related to their grade in the class.  There is also no reference to reliability (e.g.scores are not random so that if students take a test twice, their scores should be roughly comparable as measured by a reliability coefficient [a correlation between scores across students]).   To have these essential features requires the use of standardized tests such as the CAASP and MDTP. There is a discussion of giving students feedback on their assessment which is laudable; however, to the extent that feedback is vague and unreliable rather than providing refined information on subskill mastery using measures that meet the rigorous psychometric standards of the National Center of Intensive Intervention (NCII), it is useless. NWEAMAP would give far more granular detail about subskill mastery. Refer to the www.thescienceofmath.com for further discussion. If a goal of the Framework is to increase math ability, there is no discussion of using evidence-based norms to compare whether students are falling behind expected rates of improvement.

Subject: Public Comment in Support of California's Mathematics Framework

Dear California Department of Education,

I am writing to provide my support for the proposed Mathematics Framework for California. As an educator and advocate for quality mathematics education, I commend the Department for its dedication to developing a comprehensive framework that aligns with research-based practices and addresses the needs of all students.

I would like to express my enthusiasm for the emphasis on mathematical thinking, problem-solving, and reasoning throughout the framework. These skills are crucial for students to develop a deep understanding of mathematics and apply their knowledge to real-world situations. By promoting these skills, the Mathematics Framework will empower students to become critical thinkers and lifelong learners.

Chapter 5 stands out as a significant advancement in mathematics education, as it specifically addresses the importance of data science skills for students in the modern era. The progressions outlined in this chapter provide clear and age-appropriate learning pathways, enabling students to develop a strong foundation in data literacy and engage in meaningful applications of mathematics to real-world scenarios.

I would also like to express my appreciation for the framework's effort to clarify various terms used throughout the document. The definitions and explanations provided for mathematical concepts and processes are thorough and beneficial for educators and students alike. However, I would like to recommend that the term ""data cleaning"" be included in the glossary or further elaborated within the framework. Clarifying this term will ensure a shared understanding among educators and students, as data cleaning is a crucial step in the data science process.

While the framework effectively connected mathematics with computer science standards, I believe there is an opportunity to establish additional connections with other disciplines. Mathematics has inherent ties with science, technology, engineering, and the arts. By emphasizing interdisciplinary connections and providing guidance on integrating mathematics with these disciplines, the framework can foster a holistic and well-rounded education, showcasing the interconnectedness of mathematics with various fields of study.

I appreciate the mention of specific tools that support data analysis and visualization in the framework. However, I would like to underscore the importance of incorporating commonly used programming languages into data science education. Proficiency in programming languages like Python and R has become increasingly vital in the field of data science. By prioritizing the inclusion of these programming languages in the framework, students will develop practical skills that align with industry demands, better preparing them for future careers and academic pursuits.

I would like to emphasize the alignment between the skills presented in the Mathematics Framework for California and the data skills assessed in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP data from 2011 to 2022 reveals a decline in average scores and achievement levels in mathematics for California, with an average scale score change of -6 and a grade level loss of -0.5. By incorporating data science concepts and emphasizing data literacy in the mathematics curriculum, as outlined in the framework, California can address this decline and equip students with the necessary skills to succeed in mathematics and beyond. The inclusion of data analysis, interpretation, and problem-solving skills will empower students to navigate the increasingly data-driven world, supporting their academic and career readiness.

In addition, I would like to highlight the growing recognition of the importance of data science education in other states across the country. For instance, Virginia has taken a significant step by creating and approving standalone data science standards, acknowledging the unique skill set required to navigate and analyze data effectively. Similarly, Utah is actively conducting a pilot program that includes standalone data science courses, accompanied by cohorts of professional development for teachers. These initiatives, along with the widespread adoption of the data science course code created by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the National School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), demonstrate the increasing nationwide recognition of the need to equip students with data science skills. Almost half of the country has either implemented the SCED data science course code or developed their own data science course codes. By incorporating data science concepts into the Mathematics Framework for California, the state can join these leading efforts and ensure that its students are prepared for the data-driven world they will encounter in their academic and professional lives. This alignment with national trends will enable California students to develop the necessary tools to thrive in the data-driven world, remain competitive in an evolving job market, and contribute to the innovation and growth of the state.

Thank you for considering my testimony. I want to express my deep appreciation for the Mathematics Framework for California and emphasize how much I value it as an exceptional tool for teachers. The framework provides comprehensive guidance and innovative strategies that empower educators to deliver engaging instruction, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and data literacy skills among their students. By equipping teachers with the necessary resources and support, the framework ensures that students receive a high-quality mathematics education that prepares them for success in the 21st century. I firmly believe that the implementation of the Mathematics Framework will have a positive and transformative impact on mathematics education in California. Should you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I eagerly anticipate the implementation of the Mathematics Framework and the incredible benefits it will bring to both teachers and students in California.

Kim Glenchur,,kglench8@gmail.com,Item 11 - Adoption of the Mathematics Framework,Oppose,"My experiences are those as a mother, 8 years reading UC Berkeley
freshman applications, and 15 years advising college applicants. My educational
background is Stanford Human Biology major, Johns Hopkins MA, and UC Berkeley
MBA. Having had 2 sons in Stanford's EPGY (Educational Program for Gifted Youth)
math program, I strongly disagree with the proposed California Math Framework
(CMF). (I also have a son with a learning disability, so I understand that side
of education.) The EPGY program was based on the best math programs from around
the world. EPGY allowed a math-gifted son to wrap up most engineering-required
math courses by the end of high school (HS). Why not adapt the EPGY pedagogy for
the CMF?

I am commenting because I believe that the proposed CMF is being determined by
those who fear math. That a female, Ms. Boaler, supports a CMF that begins
algebra I in 9th grade makes me wonder whether the premise is equity or a
cultural convention of females fearing math. About a decade ago at a Stanford
class reunion, a workshop showed female math SAT curves shifted to the left of
similarly shaped male SAT curves. If Asian females are prepped by telling them
that Asians do well in math, their SAT curves showed no difference from male
curves.

Perhaps the problem is finding good math teachers. Flipped classrooms may be the
solution: Assign Khan Academy videos as homework and use math class periods as
guided practice. I've heard of data science as an algebra 2 option, but that can
reduce admission eligibility to other US colleges that don't recognize that
equivalence. Algebra 2 is also a prerequisite for statistics courses required by
today‚Äôs majors, including social sciences.

What my gifted sons did is typical of top students seen in UC Berkeley
applications. Completing algebra I and geometry in middle school allows calculus
before HS graduation, required for admission to Caltech, Harvey Mudd, and many
business majors. The proposed CMF makes HS calculus impossible unless a student
doubles up on math courses. The proposed CMF actually reduces equity in that
well-informed students could find ways to get extra math courses.

In short, all my experiences say that beginning algebra I in 9th grade retards
development of math gifted students and destroys eligibility for meeting college
math requirements. Going into the Brave New World of AI reminds me of how it was
after Sputnik. The proposed CMF doesn't seem to recognize these realities and
should be trashed. This reminds me of when my sons were to learn 'whole-word'
reading instead of phonics. A generation of kids didn't learn to read. There is
a fundamental math/science pathway but, instead of watered-down a-g math
courses, an innovative math pedagogy would also support business and hands-on
careers. The beauty of math can be seen in the traditional path. An alternative
path could show that figures don't lie, but liars figure. Meanwhile, the rest of
the world supplies immigrants who fill US tech jobs.

NAEP math scores have plunged in CA. CA fails to include discussion of bringing
up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the NAEP proves.
There is NO provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math
class as a discussion class on equity. UDL contractual agreement to teach math
is not going to raise math scores or math competency. NAEP scores lowest in a
decade. Where is the math proficiency component in the math framework?

CA needs research based strategies for achievement, especially if minority

Michael Malione,,michael.malione@gmail.com,"Item 11 - Adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California
Public Schools, Kindergarten Thr...",Oppose,"Following up on my prior comment, the attached .pdf document shows
what was problematic about many of the citations in the SFR of the CMF. I
haven't had time to scour the citations in the 2023 draft, but I see that many
of these issues are still outstanding. Other commenters have already pointed to
some of them. There is no room for any such misrepresentation in a document that
will guide the mathematics education for all the public schools in our nation's
most populous state. The fact that these false and misleading citations are
driving state-issued guidelines is unacceptable, and the framework needs to be
rejected.

Furthermore, the framework's recommendation pertaining to a Data Science high
school course option are based on the course qualifying for Area C of the
University of California's A-G requirements, a status that the UC BOARS
Committee is meeting today to consider revoking. In light of the fact that this
revocation is potentially imminent, it is foolish to adopt a flawed standard
that won't even pass muster with the University of California and the California
State University systems. These courses have already been rejected as fulfilling
the math requirements for CSU schools. It would be incredibly shortsighted to
adopt a framework containing curricular recommendations that its own state
college system has rejected.

Supporters of the framework are hearing the good intentions and exercising their
faith in the good will of the authors, but they seem to be oblivious to these
many issues, issues which, as a matter of procedure should have stopped this
framework dead in its tracks long ago.

Additional issues, which I am echoing from other commenters:

- The CMF asserts with scant evidence that the solution the failings of
California's public schools is to
adopt the CMF writers' preferred instructional approaches. There is a large body
of research and experience
that indicates other approaches would better close math achievement gaps and
improve mathematics instruction.

- The lead writer of the CMF writing team had a conflict of interest because,
much of the 'research' cited to support the authors' claims, particularly with
regard to detracking, as well as approaches recommended come from the
organization she runs -- YouCubed.org. This author earns substantial income
consulting with CA public school districts advising on mathematics curricular
changes, and there is a fair likelihood that the state will approve textbooks
that
she's authored -- a prohibited conflict of interest.

- If the instructional and policy recommendations in the CMF are followed by
California
school districts, it is my informed opinion that California K-12 students'
achievements
in mathematics will continue to decline. The first chapter of the CMF says it is
'centered
around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other
and to
authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet
varied
learning needs.' This focus on big ideas, connection to 'authentic' student
contexts,
and vague notions of 'multidimensional ways' rooted in UDL will necessarily
reduce instructional time in development of basic mathematical skills.

As a long time educator, I am so pleased the California is looking forward to
the future of our state by developing our future mathematicians. The proposed
framework empowers students to see math as relevant to their daily lives and
useful in solving problems. With the rise of AI, our students need to see the
application of math and develop the critical thinking skills to support
themselves in their future careers. All students need to see themselves as
capable learners. The interconnectedness of the Big Ideas in conjunction with
the Drivers of Investigation, Content Connections, and Math Practices will
create deeper, richer math learning for our students. I look forward to
developing lessons and math units that utilize multiple standards and are
connected to my student's lives and interests. It really opens up opportunities
for students to see the connections of math and science, computer science,
engineering, and social studies.

The focus on equity and all student's ability to learn is crucial for us to see
success across all demographic subgroups. All students need to receive the
appropriate supports and the framework lays out some great strategies to allow
our high students to soar and our low students to find success in math. So many
students get turned off by math because they feel like they are always failing.
The new framework helps develop students mathematical mindsets and provides
opportunities for success via the multidimensional nature of mathematics.

I wholeheartedly support the framework and what it will do for our students.
Please adopt it.

I like that these framework revisions focus on teaching kids how math works, so
they have a stronger conceptual understanding of math. I also appreciate that
this framework includes culturally responsive tasks which moves away from
teaching kids to memorize formulas but not necessarily understanding what they
are doing - moving away from worksheets on worksheets of math facts to actual
engaging learning.
