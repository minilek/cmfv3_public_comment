My children attend high school and middle\\nschool in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in the city of Los\\nAngeles, CA. They have attended CA public schools since they were in\\nkindergarten. (Stakeholders are addressed in Ch. 1 of the California Math\\nFramework.)\\n\\nOur family is in a unique position in that our children have tried out both\\ntraditional math programs and models that align with the new California Math\\nFramework in their respective schools. Having lived experience with the\\nrecommendations put forth in the CMF, I am writing to urge the CA BOE to reject\\nthe proposed California Math Framework in its current form.\\n\\nI have heard the phrase, \u201cyour children are not a data set,\u201d but they are the\\ndata set I know the best. My kids took math at public schools that have adopted\\nthe recommendations contained in the new CMF and math at public schools that did\\nnot. Both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed CMF\\nmodels of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs\\nthat did not employ the CMF\u2019s recommendations.\\n\\nMy children\u2019s first elementary school was an independent charter named Larchmont\\nCharter School in Los Angeles. Larchmont was an early adopter of the CMF\u2019s\\nproposed models. Years before other public schools worked to align themselves\\nwith the new CMF, faculty at Larchmont Charter School worked closely with UCLA\u2019s\\nCenter X / UCLA Mathematics Project to incorporate CGI Math into their\\ncurriculum. Larchmont teachers followed Jo Boaler at Stanford and her work\\nbuilding on Carol Dweck\u2019s \u201cgrowth mindsets,\u201d which guided them in creating model\\nmath classrooms for their students. Larchmont was a high-performing school with\\nengaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the PD.\\n\\nThe resulting math program, however, was not effective for my two kids, both of\\nwhom work several years above grade level. My students bemoaned the coursework,\\nwhich was remedial, repetitive, slow-paced, and featured a lot of writing about\\ntheir thinking for very simple concepts. Once they moved over to LAUSD proper,\\nwhich followed a more traditional math path, they both soared ahead and\\ndiscovered they loved math. In fifth grade, my daughter remarked, \u201cI can\u2019t\\nbelieve Larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm!\u201d\\n\\nUsing a standard algorithm (and just\u2026doing math problems) made everything click\\ninto place for these particular kids. I was therefore dismayed to see the\\ncurrent CMF recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until\\nmuch later in elementary \u2013 using culminating standards as a guide of when to\\nteach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the\\nCommon Core (see elementary school guidance re: when multiplication, division,\\netc. are taught, CMF page 83.)\\n\\nBut Larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models. Last year, in\\nLAUSD, our child\u2019s former school, Gaspar de Portola Middle School implemented a\\npilot program for the district that was aligned with the new CMF. Portola\\nswitched from teaching the \u201cBig Ideas\u201d math curriculum to \u201cIllustrative Math\u201d in\\n2022-2023. Teachers underwent extensive PD. Parent booster groups spent tens of\\nthousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new\\ncurriculum.\\n\\nAgain, the progressive math model (executed by excellent teachers and staff) was\\na disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace. Gaspar de\\nPortola Middle School houses a Highly Gifted Magnet (HGM) for kids who typically\\nwork 3 years ahead of grade level. Parents at the HGM, (knowing nothing about\\nthe Math Wars raging in Sacramento) were incredibly dismayed by the new\\ncurriculum.\\n\\nOne parent, a STEM PhD and retired astrophysicist, patiently did every problem\\nset in both the \u201cBig Ideas\u201d (traditional) textbook and the (new) \u201cIllustrative\\nMath\u201d textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the\\nnew progressive model. Dismayed by what he found, he wrote a letter to our\\nprincipal, which I am excerpting here:\\n\\n\u201cAs for IM, first of all, I strongly applaud LAUSD and Portola\\u0027s initiative and\\neffort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state\\nof math proficiency in the general student population in LAUSD and in the\\ncountry. IM textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited\\nto many, if not most student\\u0027s needs and ability. IM tries to make students\\nfully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by\\nreorganizing math topics, offering a lot of repetitions, and showing various\\nways to explain the same concepts. My son (*name withheld) I believe, is\\nbenefitting from IM\u2019s methodology, repetitiveness, and slower pace.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHowever, I have to say that IM does not serve HGM kids\u2019 needs well at all\\n(especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond) and\\nis a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability. Ultimately it does\\nnot prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like Pre-Cal and\\nCalculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and\\napproach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like Big Idea Math.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHere are some of the IM\u2019s shortcomings as a high-school level math textbook in\\nthe context of HGM (especially Algebra 1\\u00262, and Geometry):\u201d\\n\\n- \u201cIM covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower\\nknowledge base due to its slower pace. It does not delve deep enough into\\nmaterials, compared to Big Ideas Math and other common core math textbooks. It\\noffers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts, which\\nbores and even confuses students.\u201d\\n\\n- \u201cIM lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and\\nseems to be a \\u0027watered-down\\u0027 version of traditional math textbooks.\u201d\\n\\n- \u201cIM\u2019s approach does not align with that of college textbooks.\u201d\\n\\n- \u201cIM doesn\\u0027t offer enough texts, guidelines, and exercises after each\\nlesson/chapter for students to further their investigation and study after\\nschool.\u201d\\n\\n- \u201cIM\u2019s lesson/chapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard\\nmathematical terms, equations, theorems, and conventions that are essential for\\na smooth transition to future courses such as Calculus and Physics.\u201d \u2026\\n\\n- \u201cWe have math teachers at HGM who are highly skilled in using Big Idea Math.\\nHaving them switch to a very different and possibly inferior way of teaching\\nseems to be a huge waste of their talent and expertise.\u201d\\n\\n- \u201cBecause of the deficiency of the IM textbook and curriculum, some HGM parents\\nare compelled to seek outside help and tutoring, which adds extra and\\nunnecessary workload and burden to students and parents at home.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOverall, I believe that whilst IM may be a suitable choice for the general\\nstudent population, it is unfortunately an inadequate and unsuitable selection\\nfor the HGM students.\u201d\\n(End of excerpted letter)\\n\\nHere, the critique of Illustrative Math can be extrapolated and applied to the\\ngeneral shape of the math curriculum put forth in the new CMF, as the underlying\\nprinciples and techniques are similar to those outlined in the first several\\nchapters of the CMF.\\n\\nIn two separate schools in two separate examples, our family discovered that new\\nprogressive math curriculum aligned with the CMF was woefully inadequate when it\\ncame to addressing the specific set of learning needs of high achievers. Nor did\\nit adequately prepare students for college level math. The slow pace and the\\nrepetition of the more progressive math models (which circle back again and\\nagain) temporarily killed the fast learners\u2019 love of math.\\n\\nAt scale, the proposed CMF recommendations will potentially violate state law by\\nmaking high achievers repeat classes and concepts they have already mastered.\\nThose learners deserve to experience growth within their Zones of Proximal\\nDevelopment. Further, despite the CMF throwing out decades of research re:\\ngifted learners (by asserting that there is no such thing \u2013 it\u2019s all a growth\\nmindset) these learners require appropriate placement as guaranteed by the Math\\nPlacement Act to support their academic growth.\\n\\nAll this said, the population of learners who needs the most help with math in\\nCA is not the group of outliers at the top. The CMF is rightly concerned with\\nthe math achievement gap between various ethnic, racial, and cultural groups.\\n\\nHowever, this is also where the proposed CMF is at its most cynical. For a\\ndocument that is primarily concerned with equity, the authors of the CMF do not\\noffer solid data and peer-reviewed research to support their hypothesis that\\ntheir drastic overhaul to math education in CA will actually make anything more\\nequitable for those who need it most.\\nIn previous drafts of the CMF, the authors cited San Francisco Unified School\\nDistrict\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d with de-tracking Algebra in 2014 as proof that their\\napproach to revamping K-12 math worked. When new information re: SFUSD\u2019s program\\nsurfaced, the available data did not support that claim. In fact, it now appears\\nthat SFUSD\u2019s de-tracking experiment was a disaster, further exacerbating the\\nmath achievement gap for black and Latinx students. The only way students could\\nprepare for the accelerated classes in high school was to take expensive\\nsupplemental math outside of their public schools as a workaround.\\nEconomically-disadvantaged kids continued to be the ones least likely to take\\nthe private classes. (See: \u201cSFUSD\\u0027s delay of algebra 1 has created a nightmare\\nof workarounds\u201d by Rex Ridgeway, San Francisco Examiner, March 8, 2023)\\nWhile SFUSD\u2019s failed math experiment has been removed from this draft of the\\nCMF, the model that drove SFUSD\u2019s failure remains the proposed math model of\\nchoice for the California Board of Education. Why? What data supports the\\nauthors\u2019 hypothesis without hard facts to back it?\\nThe CMF authors\u2019 biggest argument against traditional math is that it\\nperpetuates inequity via tracking. Their solution is to remove accelerated\\nclasses and de-track, but they wind up proposing a whole new track (data\\nscience) that will heartlessly trap kids who were hoping to enter STEM majors in\\ncollege into a new dead end.\\nAs Brian Conrad of Stanford has explained at length, when students take data\\nscience as an alternative to the pre-requisite they actually need, calculus, the\\neffect will be to kill their STEM careers before they start. How is taking\\naccelerated math in middle school a problem, but encouraging kids to pursue an\\nentirely new data science track for the entirety of their high school career\\nthat may or may not meet UC standards for advanced math \u2013 that may bar them from\\nSTEM majors - not a dirty trick? Here, the BOE must consider the following\\narticle just printed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, \u201cThe University of\\nCalifornia Changed Its Math Standards. Some Faculty Aren\u2019t Happy\u201d by Stephanie\\nM. Lee, 7/6/23. The article backs up Conrad\u2019s many critiques of Chapter 5 of the\\nCMF. The inequity and issues that the data science track poses must be addressed\\nbefore moving forward.\\nThe problem with \u201ctracking,\u201d after all, is getting stuck on a track. However,\\nwhen tracks are turned into pathways with many entryways, students can learn at\\nan appropriate pace with a similar ability group (a much needed grouping in\\nlarge public schools). They can even level-up to a new group without the\\ncurriculum getting dumbed-down into a \u201cone sized fits all model.\u201d Why was this\\nsolution not considered? Why is the de-tracking model used in SFUSD still in the\\nCMF (without the accompanying data showing it didn\u2019t work) when math models like\\nthose employed in the Long Beach Unified School District \u2013 where kids can be\\ntaught on different pathways that they can leave and enter - have actually\\nproven to deliver more equitable results?\\n\\nFinally, the authors of the CMF have targeted anyone raising questions about\\ntheir data, methods, and models as politically-motivated. In Chapter 9, the\\nauthors assert re: the Common Core adoption of 2001 that, \u201cThe most organized\\nresistance came from politically-affiliated groups who resist equitable change\\n(see for example, Evers, 2021). More recently, the changes proposed for the\\nCalifornia Math Framework have been met with similar opposition.\u201d Like many big\\nsweeping statements, this last assertion is not backed by a peer-reviewed study.\\nIt does not take into account the letter to the BOE signed by over 1,1000 STEM\\nprofessionals \u2013 or the valid critiques (still unaddressed) that came from the\\nhead of undergraduate math at Stanford, Brian Conrad. It is instead a link to a\\nYouCubed blog post.\\n\\nAnd here is the most pressing issue. The BOE must reject any references in this\\ncurrent framework that do not hold up under scrutiny. There should be no\\nnon-academic research included in the CMF. Non peer-reviewed papers have no\\nstandards. They have no business being used as references for a math framework\\ndesigned to change the schooling of millions of students. Blog posts and opinion\\npieces must be removed for the CMF to have any credulity as an academic\\ndocument. The many references to YouCubed and the CMF authors\u2019 commercial\\nconcerns must be removed. (Given the sheer amount of new textbooks that will be\\nrequired by the new CMF, it is a massive conflict of interest to make this\\ndocument an infomercial for the YouCubed group.)\\n\\nThe new revised CMF still reads as an aspirational document. It is a massive\\nhypothesis without the peer-reviewed data to back up its assertions. While it\\nhas been clear for some time that the CMF math models do not work for the\\nfastest learners, the CMF will more gravely change math for all children in the\\nstate in the name of equity, with no proof that its methods and models are able\\nto deliver equitable results for students who are at the most risk of being\\nsidelined in math.\\n\\nAs a parent stakeholder whose family has been the test case for this big ideas\\nand concepts aligned with this math model, I urge you to vote \u201cno\u201d on adopting\\nthe revised CMF. Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"Title\":\"SBECOMMENT-20230707-095547\",\"Author\":\"11;#SBE SharePoint

My kids took math at public schools that have adopted\\nthe recommendations contained in the new CMF and math at public schools that did\\nnot. Both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed CMF\\nmodels of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs\\nthat did not employ the CMF\\u2019s recommendations.\\n\\nMy children\\u2019s first elementary school was an independent charter named Larchmont\\nCharter School in Los Angeles. Larchmont was an early adopter of the CMF\\u2019s\\nproposed models. Years before other public schools worked to align themselves\\nwith the new CMF, faculty at Larchmont Charter School worked closely with UCLA\\u2019s\\nCenter X \\u002f UCLA Mathematics Project to incorporate CGI Math into their\\ncurriculum. Larchmont teachers followed Jo Boaler at Stanford and her work\\nbuilding on Carol Dweck\\u2019s \\u201cgrowth mindsets,\\u201d which guided them in creating model\\nmath classrooms for their students. Larchmont was a high-performing school with\\nengaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the PD.\\n\\nThe resulting math program, however, was not effective for my two kids, both of\\nwhom work several years above grade level. My students bemoaned the coursework,\\nwhich was remedial, repetitive, slow-paced, and featured a lot of writing about\\ntheir thinking for very simple concepts. Once they moved over to LAUSD proper,\\nwhich followed a more traditional math path, they both soared ahead and\\ndiscovered they loved math. In fifth grade, my daughter remarked, \\u201cI can\\u2019t\\nbelieve Larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm!\\u201d\\n\\nUsing a standard algorithm (and just\\u2026doing math problems) made everything click\\ninto place for these particular kids. I was therefore dismayed to see the\\ncurrent CMF recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until\\nmuch later in elementary \\u2013 using culminating standards as a guide of when to\\nteach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the\\nCommon Core (see elementary school guidance re: when multiplication, division,\\netc. are taught, CMF page 83.)\\n\\nBut Larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models. Last year, in\\nLAUSD, our child\\u2019s former school, Gaspar de Portola Middle School implemented a\\npilot program for the district that was aligned with the new CMF. Portola\\nswitched from teaching the \\u201cBig Ideas\\u201d math curriculum to \\u201cIllustrative Math\\u201d in\\n2022-2023. Teachers underwent extensive PD. Parent booster groups spent tens of\\nthousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new\\ncurriculum.\\n\\nAgain, the progressive math model (executed by excellent teachers and staff) was\\na disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace. Gaspar de\\nPortola Middle School houses a Highly Gifted Magnet (HGM) for kids who typically\\nwork 3 years ahead of grade level. Parents at the HGM, (knowing nothing about\\nthe Math Wars raging in Sacramento) were incredibly dismayed by the new\\ncurriculum.\\n\\nOne parent, a STEM PhD and retired astrophysicist, patiently did every problem\\nset in both the \\u201cBig Ideas\\u201d (traditional) textbook and the (new) \\u201cIllustrative\\nMath\\u201d textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the\\nnew progressive model. Dismayed by what he found, he wrote a letter to our\\nprincipal, which I am excerpting here:\\n\\n\\u201cAs for IM, first of all, I strongly applaud LAUSD and Portola's initiative and\\neffort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state\\nof math proficiency in the general student population in LAUSD and in the\\ncountry. IM textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited\\nto many, if not most student's needs and ability. IM tries to make students\\nfully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by\\nreorganizing math topics, offering a lot of repetitions, and showing various\\nways to explain the same concepts. My son (*name withheld) I believe, is\\nbenefitting from IM\\u2019s methodology, repetitiveness, and slower pace.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHowever, I have to say that IM does not serve HGM kids\\u2019 needs well at all\\n(especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond) and\\nis a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability. Ultimately it does\\nnot prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like Pre-Cal and\\nCalculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and\\napproach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like Big Idea Math.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHere are some of the IM\\u2019s shortcomings as a high-school level math textbook in\\nthe context of HGM (especially Algebra 1&2, and Geometry):\\u201d\\n\\n- \\u201cIM covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower\\nknowledge base due to its slower pace. It does not delve deep enough into\\nmaterials, compared to Big Ideas Math and other common core math textbooks. It\\noffers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts, which\\nbores and even confuses students.\\u201d\\n\\n- \\u201cIM lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and\\nseems to be a 'watered-down' version of traditional math textbooks.\\u201d\\n\\n- \\u201cIM\\u2019s approach does not align with that of college textbooks.\\u201d\\n\\n- \\u201cIM doesn't offer enough texts, guidelines, and exercises after each\\nlesson\\u002fchapter for students to further their investigation and study after\\nschool.\\u201d\\n\\n- \\u201cIM\\u2019s lesson\\u002fchapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard\\nmathematical terms, equations, theorems, and conventions that are essential for\\na smooth transition to future courses such as Calculus and Physics.\\u201d \\u2026\\n\\n- \\u201cWe have math teachers at HGM who are highly skilled in using Big Idea Math.\\nHaving them switch to a very different and possibly inferior way of teaching\\nseems to be a huge waste of their talent and expertise.\\u201d\\n\\n- \\u201cBecause of the deficiency of the IM textbook and curriculum, some HGM parents\\nare compelled to seek outside help and tutoring, which adds extra and\\nunnecessary workload and burden to students and parents at home.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOverall, I believe that whilst IM may be a suitable choice for the general\\nstudent population, it is unfortunately an inadequate and unsuitable selection\\nfor the HGM students.\\u201d\\n(End of excerpted letter)\\n\\nHere, the critique of Illustrative Math can be extrapolated and applied to the\\ngeneral shape of the math curriculum put forth in the new CMF, as the underlying\\nprinciples and techniques are similar to those outlined in the first several\\nchapters of the CMF.\\n\\nIn two separate schools in two separate examples, our family discovered that new\\nprogressive math curriculum aligned with the CMF was woefully inadequate when it\\ncame to addressing the specific set of learning needs of high achievers. Nor did\\nit adequately prepare students for college level math. The slow pace and the\\nrepetition of the more progressive math models (which circle back again and\\nagain) temporarily killed the fast learners\\u2019 love of math.\\n\\nAt scale, the proposed CMF recommendations will potentially violate state law by\\nmaking high achievers repeat classes and concepts they have already mastered.\\nThose learners deserve to experience growth within their Zones of Proximal\\nDevelopment. Further, despite the CMF throwing out decades of research re:\\ngifted learners (by asserting that there is no such thing \\u2013 it\\u2019s all a growth\\nmindset) these learners require appropriate placement as guaranteed by the Math\\nPlacement Act to support their academic growth.\\n\\nAll this said, the population of learners who needs the most help with math in\\nCA is not the group of outliers at the top. The CMF is rightly concerned with\\nthe math achievement gap between various ethnic, racial, and cultural groups.\\n\\nHowever, this is also where the proposed CMF is at its most cynical. For a\\ndocument that is primarily concerned with equity, the authors of the CMF do not\\noffer solid data and peer-reviewed research to support their hypothesis that\\ntheir drastic overhaul to math education in CA will actually make anything more\\nequitable for those who need it most.\\nIn previous drafts of the CMF, the authors cited San Francisco Unified School\\nDistrict\\u2019s \\u201csuccess\\u201d with de-tracking Algebra in 2014 as proof that their\\napproach to revamping K-12 math worked. When new information re: SFUSD\\u2019s program\\nsurfaced, the available data did not support that claim. In fact, it now appears\\nthat SFUSD\\u2019s de-tracking experiment was a disaster, further exacerbating the\\nmath achievement gap for black and Latinx students. The only way students could\\nprepare for the accelerated classes in high school was to take expensive\\nsupplemental math outside of their public schools as a workaround.\\nEconomically-disadvantaged kids continued to be the ones least likely to take\\nthe private classes. (See: \\u201cSFUSD's delay of algebra 1 has created a nightmare\\nof workarounds\\u201d by Rex Ridgeway, San Francisco Examiner, March 8, 2023)\\nWhile SFUSD\\u2019s failed math experiment has been removed from this draft of the\\nCMF, the model that drove SFUSD\\u2019s failure remains the proposed math model of\\nchoice for the California Board of Education. Why? What data supports the\\nauthors\\u2019 hypothesis without hard facts to back it?\\nThe CMF authors\\u2019 biggest argument against traditional math is that it\\nperpetuates inequity via tracking. Their solution is to remove accelerated\\nclasses and de-track, but they wind up proposing a whole new track (data\\nscience) that will heartlessly trap kids who were hoping to enter STEM majors in\\ncollege into a new dead end.\\nAs Brian Conrad of Stanford has explained at length, when students take data\\nscience as an alternative to the pre-requisite they actually need, calculus, the\\neffect will be to kill their STEM careers before they start. How is taking\\naccelerated math in middle school a problem, but encouraging kids to pursue an\\nentirely new data science track for the entirety of their high school career\\nthat may or may not meet UC standards for advanced math \\u2013 that may bar them from\\nSTEM majors - not a dirty trick? Here, the BOE must consider the following\\narticle just printed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, \\u201cThe University of\\nCalifornia Changed Its Math Standards. Some Faculty Aren\\u2019t Happy\\u201d by Stephanie\\nM. Lee, 7\\u002f6\\u002f23. The article backs up Conrad\\u2019s many critiques of Chapter 5 of the\\nCMF. The inequity and issues that the data science track poses must be addressed\\nbefore moving forward.\\nThe problem with \\u201ctracking,\\u201d after all, is getting stuck on a track. However,\\nwhen tracks are turned into pathways with many entryways, students can learn at\\nan appropriate pace with a similar ability group (a much needed grouping in\\nlarge public schools). They can even level-up to a new group without the\\ncurriculum getting dumbed-down into a \\u201cone sized fits all model.\\u201d Why was this\\nsolution not considered? Why is the de-tracking model used in SFUSD still in the\\nCMF (without the accompanying data showing it didn\\u2019t work) when math models like\\nthose employed in the Long Beach Unified School District \\u2013 where kids can be\\ntaught on different pathways that they can leave and enter - have actually\\nproven to deliver more equitable results?\\n\\nFinally, the authors of the CMF have targeted anyone raising questions about\\ntheir data, methods, and models as politically-motivated. In Chapter 9, the\\nauthors assert re: the Common Core adoption of 2001 that, \\u201cThe most organized\\nresistance came from politically-affiliated groups who resist equitable change\\n(see for example, Evers, 2021). More recently, the changes proposed for the\\nCalifornia Math Framework have been met with similar opposition.\\u201d Like many big\\nsweeping statements, this last assertion is not backed by a peer-reviewed study.\\nIt does not take into account the letter to the BOE signed by over 1,1000 STEM\\nprofessionals \\u2013 or the valid critiques (still unaddressed) that came from the\\nhead of undergraduate math at Stanford, Brian Conrad. It is instead a link to a\\nYouCubed blog post.\\n\\nAnd here is the most pressing issue. The BOE must reject any references in this\\ncurrent framework that do not hold up under scrutiny. There should be no\\nnon-academic research included in the CMF. Non peer-reviewed papers have no\\nstandards. They have no business being used as references for a math framework\\ndesigned to change the schooling of millions of students. Blog posts and opinion\\npieces must be removed for the CMF to have any credulity as an academic\\ndocument. The many references to YouCubed and the CMF authors\\u2019 commercial\\nconcerns must be removed. (Given the sheer amount of new textbooks that will be\\nrequired by the new CMF, it is a massive conflict of interest to make this\\ndocument an infomercial for the YouCubed group.)\\n\\nThe new revised CMF still reads as an aspirational document. It is a massive\\nhypothesis without the peer-reviewed data to back up its assertions. While it\\nhas been clear for some time that the CMF math models do not work for the\\nfastest learners, the CMF will more gravely change math for all children in the\\nstate in the name of equity, with no proof that its methods and models are able\\nto deliver equitable results for students who are at the most risk of being\\nsidelined in math.\\n\\nAs a parent stakeholder whose family has been the test case for this big ideas\\nand concepts aligned with this math model, I urge you to vote \\u201cno\\u201d on adopting\\nthe revised CMF. Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\r\n\"Title\": \"SBECOMMENT-20230707-095547\",\r\n\"ContentTypeId\": \"0x0100F1959B5850527B45A56A4F0D6689149900EF8C915DB4066540BDF203B5CAC305C1\",\r\n\"_ModerationComments\": \"\",\r\n\"LinkTitle\": \"SBECOMMENT-20230707-095547\",\r\n\"File_x0020_Type\": \"\",\r\n\"File_x0020_Type.mapapp\": \"\",\r\n\"HTML_x0020_File_x0020_Type.File_x0020_Type.mapcon\": \"\",\r\n\"HTML_x0020_File_x0020_Type.File_x0020_Type.mapico\": \"icgen.gif\",\r\n\"ComplianceAssetId\": \"\",\r\n\"LinkTitleNoMenu\": \"SBECOMMENT-20230707-095547\",\r\n\"LinkTitle2\": \"SBECOMMENT-20230707-095547\",\r\n\"_ModerationStatus\": \"Approved\",\r\n\"_ModerationStatus.\": \"0\",\r\n\"_ColorHex\": \"\",\r\n\"_ColorTag\": \"\",\r\n\"_Emoji\": \"\",\r\n\"ID\": \"592\",\r\n\"ContentType\": \"Item\",\r\n\"Modified\": \"7\\u002f7\\u002f2023 10:13 AM\",\r\n\"Modified.\": \"2023-07-07T17:13:08Z\",\r\n\"Modified.FriendlyDisplay\": \"1|0|5|10:13 AM\",\r\n\"Created\": \"7\\u002f7\\u002f2023 9:55 AM\",\r\n\"Created.\": \"2023-07-07T16:55:47Z\",\r\n\"Created.FriendlyDisplay\": \"1|0|5|9:55 AM\",\r\n\"Author\": [{\"id\":\"11\",\"title\":\"SBE SharePoint Online\",\"email\":\"sbe-sp@caeducation.onmicrosoft.com\",\"sip\":\"\",\"picture\":\"\"}],\r\n\"Editor\": [{\"id\":\"18\",\"title\":\"Amy Bubbico\",\"email\":\"ABubbico@sbe.ca.gov\",\"sip\":\"abubbico@sbe.ca.gov\",\"picture\":\"\"}],\r\n\"_HasCopyDestinations\": \"\",\r\n\"_HasCopyDestinations.value\": \"\",\r\n\"_CopySource\": \"\",\r\n\"owshiddenversion\": \"2\",\r\n\"WorkflowVersion\": \"1\",\r\n\"_UIVersion\": \"512\",\r\n\"_UIVersionString\": \"1.0\",\r\n\"Attachments\": \"0\",\r\n\"SelectTitle\": \"592\",\r\n\"InstanceID\": \"\",\r\n\"Order\": \"59,200\",\r\n\"Order.\": \"59200.0000000000\",\r\n\"GUID\": \"{83D49449-94C7-4BFA-9A12-E04F4DFF5D38}\",\r\n\"WorkflowInstanceID\": \"\",\r\n\"FileRef\": \"\\u002fsites\\u002fSBEPublicComments\\u002fLists\\u002fSBE Public Comments\\u002f592_.000\",\r\n\"FileDirRef\": \"\\u002fsites\\u002fSBEPublicComments\\u002fLists\\u002fSBE Public Comments\",\r\n\"Last_x0020_Modified\": \"7\\u002f7\\u002f2023 10:13 AM\",\r\n\"Last_x0020_Modified.\": \"2023-07-07T17:13:08Z\",\r\n\"Created_x0020_Date\": \"1;#2023-07-07 09:55:47\",\r\n\"Created_x0020_Date.ifnew\": \"1\",\r\n\"FSObjType\": \"0\",\r\n\"SortBehavior\": \"0\",\r\n\"PermMask\": \"0x3008031021\",\r\n\"PrincipalCount\": \"6\",\r\n\"FileLeafRef\": \"592_.000\",\r\n\"UniqueId\": \"{222976E0-75E4-44DB-93D8-16D01F99BB6B}\",\r\n\"ParentUniqueId\": \"{DA6E42DD-9F4A-46C4-B0BC-3457900A7D2B}\",\r\n\"SyncClientId\": \"\",\r\n\"ProgId\": \"\",\r\n\"ScopeId\": \"{698871BC-0725-440F-BFA7-367520EBD3F8}\",\r\n\"HTML_x0020_File_x0020_Type\": \"\",\r\n\"_EditMenuTableStart\": \"592_.000\",\r\n\"_EditMenuTableStart2\": \"592\",\r\n\"_EditMenuTableEnd\": \"592\",\r\n\"LinkFilenameNoMenu\": \"592_.000\",\r\n\"LinkFilename\": \"592_.000\",\r\n\"LinkFilename2\": \"592_.000\",\r\n\"DocIcon\": \"\",\r\n\"ServerUrl\": \"\\u002fsites\\u002fSBEPublicComments\\u002fLists\\u002fSBE Public Comments\\u002f592_.000\",\r\n\"EncodedAbsUrl\": \"https:\\u002f\\u002fcaeducation.sharepoint.com\\u002fsites\\u002fSBEPublicComments\\u002fLists\\u002fSBE%20Public%20Comments\\u002f592_.000\",\r\n\"BaseName\": \"592_\",\r\n\"MetaInfo\": [{\"lookupId\":592,\"lookupValue\":\"\",\"isSecretFieldValue\":false}],\r\n\"_Level\": \"1\",\r\n\"_IsCurrentVersion\": \"Yes\",\r\n\"_IsCurrentVersion.value\": \"1\",\r\n\"ItemChildCount\": \"0\",\r\n\"FolderChildCount\": \"0\",\r\n\"Restricted\": \"\",\r\n\"OriginatorId\": \"\",\r\n\"NoExecute\": \"0\",\r\n\"ContentVersion\": \"0\",\r\n\"_ComplianceFlags\": \"\",\r\n\"_ComplianceTag\": \"\",\r\n\"_ComplianceTagWrittenTime\": \"\",\r\n\"_ComplianceTagWrittenTime.\": \"\",\r\n\"_ComplianceTagUserId\": \"\",\r\n\"_IsRecord\": \"\",\r\n\"AccessPolicy\": \"\",\r\n\"_VirusStatus\": \"\",\r\n\"_VirusVendorID\": \"\",\r\n\"_VirusInfo\": \"\",\r\n\"AppAuthor\": \"\",\r\n\"AppEditor\": \"\",\r\n\"SMTotalSize\": \"58060\",\r\n\"SMLastModifiedDate\": \"7\\u002f7\\u002f2023 10:13 AM\",\r\n\"SMLastModifiedDate.\": \"2023-07-07T17:13:08Z\",\r\n\"SMTotalFileStreamSize\": \"0\",\r\n\"SMTotalFileCount\": \"0\",\r\n\"_CommentFlags\": \"\",\r\n\"_CommentCount\": \"\"\r\n}\r\n],\"FirstRow\" : 1,\r\n\"FolderPermissions\" : \"0x3008031021\"\r\n,\"LastRow\" : 1,\r\n\"RowLimit\" : 2147483647\r\n,\"NextHref\" : \"?0&PageFirstRow=2&View=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\"\n,\"FilterLink\" : \"?\"\n,\"ForceNoHierarchy\" : \"1\"\n,\"HierarchyHasIndention\" : \"\"\n,\"CurrentFolderSpItemUrl\" : \"\"\n\n},\"ClientFormCustomFormatter\":{\"0x0100F1959B5850527B45A56A4F0D6689149900EF8C915DB4066540BDF203B5CAC305C1\":\"{\\\"footerJSONFormatter\\\":\\\"\\\"}\"}}"
