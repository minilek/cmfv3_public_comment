This approach is much more equitable, and will\nallow kids with different learning styles to also succeed.\n\nI like that these framework revisions focus on teaching kids how math works, so\nthey have a stronger conceptual understanding of math. I also appreciate that\nthis framework includes culturally responsive tasks which moves away from\nteaching kids to memorize formulas but not necessarily understanding what they\nare doing - moving away from worksheets on worksheets of math facts to actual\nengaging learning.\n\nThere is still room for growth when considering how this framework impacts all\nmarginalized populations. I am hopeful that ongoing discussions will continue to\nsupport and include pathways for all learners. Thank you.",

    "Comments": "I support this revised CA framework because it was developed based\non research on how kids brains work alongside research on how to create more\ninclusive learning environments. This will allow us to move away from segregated\nmath (via math tracking that relies on standardized tests to place kids in math\ntracks they can\u2019t get out of). This approach is much more equitable, and will\nallow kids with different learning styles to also succeed.\n\nI like that these framework revisions focus on teaching kids how math works, so\nthey have a stronger conceptual understanding of math. I also appreciate that\nthis framework includes culturally responsive tasks which moves away from\nteaching kids to memorize formulas but not necessarily understanding what they\nare doing - moving away from worksheets on worksheets of math facts to actual\nengaging learning.\n\nThank you,\nSteve Bartram\nTeacher",

    "Comments": "Esteemed Board Members,\n\nAs a long time educator, I am so pleased the California is looking forward to\nthe future of our state by developing our future mathematicians. The proposed\nframework empowers students to see math as relevant to their daily lives and\nuseful in solving problems. With the rise of AI, our students need to see the\napplication of math and develop the critical thinking skills to support\nthemselves in their future careers. All students need to see themselves as\ncapable learners. The interconnectedness of the Big Ideas in conjunction with\nthe Drivers of Investigation, Content Connections, and Math Practices will\ncreate deeper, richer math learning for our students. I look forward to\ndeveloping lessons and math units that utilize multiple standards and are\nconnected to my student's lives and interests. It really opens up opportunities\nfor students to see the connections of math and science, computer science,\nengineering, and social studies.\n\nThe focus on equity and all student's ability to learn is crucial for us to see\nsuccess across all demographic subgroups. All students need to receive the\nappropriate supports and the framework lays out some great strategies to allow\nour high students to soar and our low students to find success in math. So many\nstudents get turned off by math because they feel like they are always failing.\nThe new framework helps develop students mathematical mindsets and provides\nopportunities for success via the multidimensional nature of mathematics.\n\nI wholeheartedly support the framework and what it will do for our students.\nPlease adopt it.\n\nThank you,\nLora Carey\nEducator in Title 1 Schools and Districts for 10 years.\n",

I\nhaven't had time to scour the citations in the 2023 draft, but I see that many\nof these issues are still outstanding. Other commenters have already pointed to\nsome of them. There is no room for any such misrepresentation in a document that\nwill guide the mathematics education for all the public schools in our nation's\nmost populous state. The fact that these false and misleading citations are\ndriving state-issued guidelines is unacceptable, and the framework needs to be\nrejected.\n\nFurthermore, the framework's recommendation pertaining to a Data Science high\nschool course option are based on the course qualifying for Area C of the\nUniversity of California's A-G requirements, a status that the UC BOARS\nCommittee is meeting today to consider revoking. In light of the fact that this\nrevocation is potentially imminent, it is foolish to adopt a flawed standard\nthat won't even pass muster with the University of California and the California\nState University systems. These courses have already been rejected as fulfilling\nthe math requirements for CSU schools. It would be incredibly shortsighted to\nadopt a framework containing curricular recommendations that its own state\ncollege system has rejected.\n\nSupporters of the framework are hearing the good intentions and exercising their\nfaith in the good will of the authors, but they seem to be oblivious to these\nmany issues, issues which, as a matter of procedure should have stopped this\nframework dead in its tracks long ago.\n\nAdditional issues, which I am echoing from other commenters:\n\n- The CMF asserts with scant evidence that the solution the failings of\nCalifornia's public schools is to\nadopt the CMF writers' preferred instructional approaches. There is a large body\nof research and experience\nthat indicates other approaches would better close math achievement gaps and\nimprove mathematics instruction.\n\n- The lead writer of the CMF writing team had a conflict of interest because,\nmuch of the 'research' cited to support the authors' claims, particularly with\nregard to detracking, as well as approaches recommended come from the\norganization she runs -- YouCubed.org. This author earns substantial income\nconsulting with CA public school districts advising on mathematics curricular\nchanges, and there is a fair likelihood that the state will approve textbooks\nthat\nshe's authored -- a prohibited conflict of interest.\n\n- If the instructional and policy recommendations in the CMF are followed by\nCalifornia\nschool districts, it is my informed opinion that California K-12 students'\nachievements\nin mathematics will continue to decline. The first chapter of the CMF says it is\n'centered\naround the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other\nand to\nauthentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet\nvaried\nlearning needs.' This focus on big ideas, connection to 'authentic' student\ncontexts,\nand vague notions of 'multidimensional ways' rooted in UDL will necessarily\nreduce instructional time in development of basic mathematical skills.\n",

Where is the math proficiency component in the math framework?\n\nCA needs research based strategies for achievement, especially if minority\ngroups are struggling with mathematics.

    "Comments": "My experiences are those as a mother, 8 years reading UC Berkeley\nfreshman applications, and 15 years advising college applicants. My educational\nbackground is Stanford Human Biology major, Johns Hopkins MA, and UC Berkeley\nMBA. Having had 2 sons in Stanford's EPGY (Educational Program for Gifted Youth)\nmath program, I strongly disagree with the proposed California Math Framework\n(CMF). (I also have a son with a learning disability, so I understand that side\nof education.) The EPGY program was based on the best math programs from around\nthe world. EPGY allowed a math-gifted son to wrap up most engineering-required\nmath courses by the end of high school (HS). Why not adapt the EPGY pedagogy for\nthe CMF?\n\nI am commenting because I believe that the proposed CMF is being determined by\nthose who fear math. That a female, Ms. Boaler, supports a CMF that begins\nalgebra I in 9th grade makes me wonder whether the premise is equity or a\ncultural convention of females fearing math. About a decade ago at a Stanford\nclass reunion, a workshop showed female math SAT curves shifted to the left of\nsimilarly shaped male SAT curves. If Asian females are prepped by telling them\nthat Asians do well in math, their SAT curves showed no difference from male\ncurves.\n\nPerhaps the problem is finding good math teachers. Flipped classrooms may be the\nsolution: Assign Khan Academy videos as homework and use math class periods as\nguided practice. I've heard of data science as an algebra 2 option, but that can\nreduce admission eligibility to other US colleges that don't recognize that\nequivalence. Algebra 2 is also a prerequisite for statistics courses required by\ntoday\u2019s majors, including social sciences.\n\nWhat my gifted sons did is typical of top students seen in UC Berkeley\napplications. Completing algebra I and geometry in middle school allows calculus\nbefore HS graduation, required for admission to Caltech, Harvey Mudd, and many\nbusiness majors. The proposed CMF makes HS calculus impossible unless a student\ndoubles up on math courses. The proposed CMF actually reduces equity in that\nwell-informed students could find ways to get extra math courses.\n\nIn short, all my experiences say that beginning algebra I in 9th grade retards\ndevelopment of math gifted students and destroys eligibility for meeting college\nmath requirements. Going into the Brave New World of AI reminds me of how it was\nafter Sputnik. The proposed CMF doesn't seem to recognize these realities and\nshould be trashed. This reminds me of when my sons were to learn 'whole-word'\nreading instead of phonics. A generation of kids didn't learn to read. There is\na fundamental math\u002fscience pathway but, instead of watered-down a-g math\ncourses, an innovative math pedagogy would also support business and hands-on\ncareers. The beauty of math can be seen in the traditional path. An alternative\npath could show that figures don't lie, but liars figure. Meanwhile, the rest of\nthe world supplies immigrants who fill US tech jobs.\n",

    "Comments": "I am opposing the 2023 Math Framework for California Public Schools\nbecause it is more concerned with students feeling \u201cpositive\u201d about math than\nthey are about students learning math. Math is a hard subject that needs to be\nlearned with rigor and a lot practices as well. The focus should be adopting the\nright teaching methods and providing positive feedback to the kids who really\nput in the efforts to learn. We could lower all the testing criteria to make\neveryone feeling good about an inflated evaluation of their math capability, but\nthat will not change the fact they are still lacking in understanding the real\nmath and cannot solve the real problems in life. This simply sets them up to\nface bigger frustrations and failures down the road. We should make students\nfeel \u201cpositive\u201d about math by teaching them proper math and enabling them to\ngain satisfaction from solving real challenging problems step by step. Often\ntimes I hear from Kids that they get bored and disengaged in the\nclassrooms\u002fschool if they are not getting the right challenges in learning.",

    "StanceontheMatter": "",
    "Comments": "Date: July 7th, 2023\nSubject: Public Comment in Support of California's Mathematics Framework\n\nDear California Department of Education,\n\nI am writing to provide my support for the proposed Mathematics Framework for California. As an educator and advocate for quality mathematics education, I commend the Department for its dedication to developing a comprehensive framework that aligns with research-based practices and addresses the needs of all students.\n\nI would like to express my enthusiasm for the emphasis on mathematical thinking, problem-solving, and reasoning throughout the framework. These skills are crucial for students to develop a deep understanding of mathematics and apply their knowledge to real-world situations. By promoting these skills, the Mathematics Framework will empower students to become critical thinkers and lifelong learners.\n\nChapter 5 stands out as a significant advancement in mathematics education, as it specifically addresses the importance of data science skills for students in the modern era. The progressions outlined in this chapter provide clear and age-appropriate learning pathways, enabling students to develop a strong foundation in data literacy and engage in meaningful applications of mathematics to real-world scenarios.\n\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the framework's effort to clarify various terms used throughout the document. The definitions and explanations provided for mathematical concepts and processes are thorough and beneficial for educators and students alike. However, I would like to recommend that the term \"data cleaning\" be included in the glossary or further elaborated within the framework. Clarifying this term will ensure a shared understanding among educators and students, as data cleaning is a crucial step in the data science process.\n\nWhile the framework effectively connected mathematics with computer science standards, I believe there is an opportunity to establish additional connections with other disciplines. Mathematics has inherent ties with science, technology, engineering, and the arts. By emphasizing interdisciplinary connections and providing guidance on integrating mathematics with these disciplines, the framework can foster a holistic and well-rounded education, showcasing the interconnectedness of mathematics with various fields of study.\n\nI appreciate the mention of specific tools that support data analysis and visualization in the framework. However, I would like to underscore the importance of incorporating commonly used programming languages into data science education. Proficiency in programming languages like Python and R has become increasingly vital in the field of data science. By prioritizing the inclusion of these programming languages in the framework, students will develop practical skills that align with industry demands, better preparing them for future careers and academic pursuits.\n\nI would like to emphasize the alignment between the skills presented in the Mathematics Framework for California and the data skills assessed in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP data from 2011 to 2022 reveals a decline in average scores and achievement levels in mathematics for California, with an average scale score change of -6 and a grade level loss of -0.5. By incorporating data science concepts and emphasizing data literacy in the mathematics curriculum, as outlined in the framework, California can address this decline and equip students with the necessary skills to succeed in mathematics and beyond. The inclusion of data analysis, interpretation, and problem-solving skills will empower students to navigate the increasingly data-driven world, supporting their academic and career readiness.\n\nIn addition, I would like to highlight the growing recognition of the importance of data science education in other states across the country. For instance, Virginia has taken a significant step by creating and approving standalone data science standards, acknowledging the unique skill set required to navigate and analyze data effectively. Similarly, Utah is actively conducting a pilot program that includes standalone data science courses, accompanied by cohorts of professional development for teachers. These initiatives, along with the widespread adoption of the data science course code created by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the National School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), demonstrate the increasing nationwide recognition of the need to equip students with data science skills. Almost half of the country has either implemented the SCED data science course code or developed their own data science course codes. By incorporating data science concepts into the Mathematics Framework for California, the state can join these leading efforts and ensure that its students are prepared for the data-driven world they will encounter in their academic and professional lives. This alignment with national trends will enable California students to develop the necessary tools to thrive in the data-driven world, remain competitive in an evolving job market, and contribute to the innovation and growth of the state.\n\nThank you for considering my testimony. I want to express my deep appreciation for the Mathematics Framework for California and emphasize how much I value it as an exceptional tool for teachers. The framework provides comprehensive guidance and innovative strategies that empower educators to deliver engaging instruction, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and data literacy skills among their students. By equipping teachers with the necessary resources and support, the framework ensures that students receive a high-quality mathematics education that prepares them for success in the 21st century. I firmly believe that the implementation of the Mathematics Framework will have a positive and transformative impact on mathematics education in California. Should you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I eagerly anticipate the implementation of the Mathematics Framework and the incredible benefits it will bring to both teachers and students in California.\n\nSincerely,\nSamantha Leav\nDirector of State Policy\nData Science 4 Everyone\nsleav@uchicago.edu\n\n",

    "Comments": "This Framework has an Inadequate Focus on the Evaluation and Goal of Math Proficiency\n\nMath builds on itself so that without assuring mastery of each topic students are unprepared, thus PROFICIENCY must be the goal, not just \u201cenhancing learning\u201d, or \u201cpositive mathematics identities\u201d. Standardized tests are most effective at evaluating proficiency.  To supplement these tests some measures allow for after the formal assessment on can \u201ctest limits\u201d, deviating from standard procedures gathering qualitative observations such as those described as \u201cformative assessment\u201d. \n\nThere is an entire chapter of over 60 pages on Assessment and no where is there a mention of modern test standards that are based on rigorous psychometric data including norms, reliability, and validity testing.  Specifically, no where is there any reference to the term test validity, the concept that assessments must have some evidence that they measure the underlying concept they purport to measure.  For example, one would expect a score on a test of Advanced Placement Calculus to predict whether students could solve Calculus problems in different college level tests or for their score on the test to be related to their grade in the class.  There is also no reference to reliability (e.g.scores are not random so that if students take a test twice, their scores should be roughly comparable as measured by a reliability coefficient [a correlation between scores across students]).   To have these essential features requires the use of standardized tests such as the CAASP and MDTP. There is a discussion of giving students feedback on their assessment which is laudable; however, to the extent that feedback is vague and unreliable rather than providing refined information on subskill mastery using measures that meet the rigorous psychometric standards of the National Center of Intensive Intervention (NCII), it is useless. NWEAMAP would give far more granular detail about subskill mastery. Refer to the www.thescienceofmath.com for further discussion. If a goal of the Framework is to increase math ability, there is no discussion of using evidence-based norms to compare whether students are falling behind expected rates of improvement.  Here are the ethical standards for Educational Testing that are freely downloadable and which must be adhered to for ethical assessment.  https:\u002f\u002fwww.testingstandards.net\u002fuploads\u002f7\u002f6\u002f6\u002f4\u002f76643089\u002fstandards_2014edition.pdf\nhttps:\u002f\u002fwww.apa.org\u002fabout\u002fpolicy\u002fguidelines-psychological-assessment-evaluation.pdf\nThis refers to psychological testing standards https:\u002f\u002fwww.apa.org\u002fscience\u002fprograms\u002ftesting\u002fstandards\n  \n\n\n-- \nAllyson C.

    "Comments": "This is regarding the new Math framework. I am a mom of 2 kids. One is in middle school and another going to college this fall. \n\nAs if now, older one is pursuing a STEM degree. He took accelerated Math classes, enjoyed them and did fairly well. He wouldn\u2019t have gotten into his dream college if he would\u2019ve not got the chance to take these classes. \n\nMy younger one, a girl, is showing keen interest in the same direction. Gone through the college admission process and High School for the older one, I am beyond scared and disappointed and angry if the board decides on curbing the accelerated Math classes. \n\nEvery kid is different , please let the parents, teachers and kids decide what they want to do. As you can\u2019t force everyone to take accelerated classes, similarly you have no right to take away accelerated classes from kids who can and want to pursue this path. US needs more of STEM graduates not less which would be very hard to nurture and produce if you decide to go on this path. \n\n",

If the rumors are true and the next version will go from more than 900 pages to a comparably trim 600 pages the public has a vested interest in being allowed the opportunity to review such a vast revision and provide further comment before the CMF is summarily adopted. \n\nPlease do not hastily approve a third draft of the CMF without allowing the public and those that have invested so much time already into the careful consideration (or in the case of Brian Conrad -dissection\u002fevisceration) of the CMF with all of its merits, ideas, errors, and flaws. \n\nPlease do not let this CMF go down in infamy as the time when the state board inadvertently canonized something that will come to be ridiculed as the balanced literacy version of math instruction.  Please, take a lesson from all of the Science of Reading zeitgeist and don't let this happen to math education in CA.\n\nA concerned parent,\nHenry Whynot\n",

    "Comments": "It is hard to disagree with some of the sentiments behind the CMF\nlike the ideas that all children should be given the chance to succeed in\nmathematics, and children from some groups have had systemic obstacles to\nsuccess. But there is a logical leap from these worthy points to the CMF's\nrecommended interventions like detracking. While all children have potential,\nanyone who has taken a math class or works in a technical field knows that there\nis also such a thing as innate mathematical ability and it is not equally\ndistributed in the population. Eliminating advanced classes, tracking, and\nselection tests removes the ability to assign children to material appropriate\nto their ability and current proficiency, and especially harms the highest\nachieving kids who are no longer challenged and stimulated in class.\nMuch of the research that the CMF is based on and cites has weak quality. For\ninstance, the non-peer reviewed paper 'Raising Expectations and Achievement: The\nImpact of Two Wide Scale De-Tracking Mathematics Reforms' by Boaler and Foster.\nStudy 2 claims a benefit from an intervention in test scores by comparing scores\non various tests in the pre-implementation year to a different test in the\nimplementation year, which makes no sense statistically.\nBy contrast, the most rigorous study of tracking, a randomized controlled trial\nled by Esther Duflo who later won the Nobel Prize, found a benefit to tracking\namong both the low- and high-achieving children (Peer Effects, Teacher\nIncentives, and the Impact of Tracking: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in\nKenya).",

    "Comments": "1.Chapter 8 needs revision to show that the two pathways through\nthe high school curriculum are alternative sequences through the same content\nstipulated in the California Standards. The current draft gives the impression\nthat the content differs substantially. In the Standards and, therefore, in\nChapter 8 functions and modeling with functions should be in the foreground for\nboth pathways. The study of functions and their use to model real world\nphenomena is foundational for calculus and for data science. It is also a more\nintuitive and motivating path to more advanced mathematics for students from\nvaried backgrounds with varied aspirations.\n2.Appendix A, pages 2 through 8 should be deleted or rewritten to align with the\ncontent in chapter 8. I recommend deletion because it is redundant with chapter\n8. ",

    "Comments": "On behalf of the California School Boards Association (CSBA), which\nrepresents nearly 1,000 school district and county boards of education\nstatewide, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on Item 11, related to the\nMathematics Framework.\n\nContinuing our shared interest in the development of a framework that best\nserves the needs of districts and the diverse students each one serves, CSBA\nsubmitted several general and more than 100 specific comments during the last\nround of public comment. After carefully reviewing the updated draft, we submit\nthe following recommendations for the final publication of the framework in\norder to help remove barriers to its implementation.\n\n\u2022 There remains a mismatch between the approach to instruction outlined within\nthe framework and the current conditions in schools. For successful\nimplementation, the instructional practices outlined within this framework would\nrequire significant new and ongoing investments with resources not currently\navailable. This is particularly notable in terms of time for planning,\ncollaboration, and professional learning. All three are associated with\nsignificant fiscal investments. While the provision of the requisite resources\nis outside of its scope, the framework should present more detailed guidance for\nhow to enact it with the constraints most schools face today.\n\n\u2022 While Chapter 13 specifically discusses instructional adoption standards that\nincorporate supports for students with disabilities, the framework should\nprovide more guidance to address the needs of this student population throughout\nthe document. The changes suggested will require extensive professional\ndevelopment to help teachers support students with disabilities in conveying\ncentral themes of the framework such as \u201cBig Ideas\u201d and additional data science\ncourses. Additionally, vignettes and teaching examples should include\nconsiderations forstudents with disabilities to make math instruction accessible\nand support California\u2019s move towards more inclusive practices.\n\n\u2022 We urge the State Board and CDE to develop resources and tools to help\ndistricts communicate potential changes in pathways. Rather than have 1000\nschool districts individually attempt to design communication tools for family\nengagement and to build a shared understanding of the vision outlined within\nthis framework, the state can play a vital role in supporting districts from the\nstart. In recognition of the fact that districts have a range of needs and serve\ndiverse contexts, CSBA welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with CDE to\nprovide input into the development of these materials.\n\nWe believe these recommendations will help address the challenges that districts\nface and expand the opportunities for students to realize the benefits of a rich\nK-12 curriculum that includes a robust mathematics curriculum.\n\nCSBA looks forward to working with the State Board of Education as it finalizes\nthe 2023 framework.\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss these comments further, I can\nbe reached at cmachado@csba.org or (916) 669-2552.",

    "Comments": "I am an 18-year-old San Franciscan who is planning on majoring in\nmathematics in college.\nIdeally, any student who desires to will be able to progress through math at\ntheir maximum possible pace without reaching a maximum class. Single-variable\ncalculus and statistics are currently framed as the highest goals of high school\nmathematics. Intelligent teenagers can and should take such classes as linear\nalgebra, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. I attended\na private high school for gifted students where these three classes are\nconsidered part of the 'extended math core,' and are highly popular. In order to\nhave time to complete such courses, students should be allowed to take more\nbasic classes early and\u002for at an accelerated pace.\nI agree that 'students who specialize in mathematics may also understand that\nvectors and matrices are additional objects that can name new types of\nquantities and can be manipulated to understand those quantities, using\noperations similar (but not identical) to those of real numbers.' Therefore, a\nclass on linear algebra should be offered.\nThe truth is that the goal of within-classroom intellectual diversity comes at\nthe cost of intellectual diversity as a whole. When students are grouped by\nability, gifted students achieve greater outcomes at no cost to less gifted\nstudents. (Card and Giuliano, 2015, write that advanced black and Hispanic\nstudents 'gain 0.5 standard deviation units in fourth-grade reading and math\nscores, with persistent gains through sixth grade' when tracking is implemented\nin fourth grade, and that they found 'no evidence of either positive or negative\nspillover effects on other students in the same school\u002fgrade cohort,' a result\nechoed in many other studies.) This is desirable because it increases the\noverall amount of achievement.\nThe framework states that 'students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus\ntook the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on\naverage than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of\nninth grade.' This is simply due to a selection effect.\nOn page 7 of the chapter on middle school, it is unclear how some students will\nbring 'experiences, perspectives, and ideas that enrich the classroom for all'\nin the context of math class. Math is not related to life experiences other than\nvery basic ones which are cross-cultural. The only 'experiences, perspectives,\nand ideas' that are useful in math class are ones which come from previous,\ncreative, or quick mathematical thinking.\nAs simple diagnostic criteria has proven more accurate than subjective clinical\njudgements, there should be a systematized and accessible process for students\nto be placed into whatever math class matches their knowledge. All students\nshould be offered an Algebra I or Mathematics I course in eighth grade so that\nstudents from any background, even students in traditionally low-performing\nschool districts, can have a chance to complete advanced math courses in\ncollege. I agree that schools should 'adjust the high school curriculum instead,\neliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do\nnot need four courses before Calculus,' or at least offer a compressed pathway\nas an option. However, providing both early algebra and high school course\ncompression are desirable, because calculus is not the most advanced math class\nthat high-performing students should be taking.\nI agree that 'if students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics\nIII or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual\npathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of\ncollege,' and I am glad that the pathway for data science rather than Algebra II\nhas been discarded. Students taking a mathematical science degree will be\nexpected to know calculus. The statement that 'most college-level study in\nmathematics will expect considerable familiarity and comfort with manipulating\nalgebraic expressions and equations and modeling with functions in order to\nsolve problems and make certain features of functions apparent' is a\nconsiderable understatement.\nIn Chapter 1, there is a discussion of 'rigor.' The provided definition is 'an\nintegrated way in which conceptual understanding, strategies for problem-solving\nand computation, and applications are learned so that each supports the other.'\nI understand that the definition was knowingly altered to provide a simple\nreference term to refer to a core concept of the framework... However, 'rigor'\nis already a word, and its true definition is related to strictness and\nstiffness. It is not about subjective understanding, but about the\nunassailability of the logic. Neither does it have to do with strategies, and\nneither does it necessarily involve any applications whatsoever. Of course\nsubjective understanding, useful strategies, and interesting applications are\nall necessary for mathematical pedagogy, but it is unclear why they have been\nhere included under rigor. In fact, I am of the belief that logical rigor should\nbe taught in school. If students learn how to read and write real proofs, then\nthey will not only be introduced to higher math, but they will also learn\nvaluable lessons about critical thinking and argument.\nOn page 7 of the chapter on data science, it is stated that 'understanding of\nlinear regression is closely related to understanding of functions and\npolynomials.' In fact, the concept of minimization of error which is essential\nto the understanding of linear regression is a concept from calculus. As the\nframework states, a data science degree requires calculus and linear algebra.\nThese subjects are essential to the topic, just as geometry is essential to the\nunderstanding of calculus. Then, if the school system wishes to prepare students\nfor statistical understanding, it should prioritize teaching students calculus\n(and linear algebra, if possible) as soon as possible. Much of the framework\naspires to the effective use of visualization and computational tools with\npre-loaded formulas. The productive use of such tools is certainly important,\nbut it is not mathematics. The practice of formulating questions to be answered\nwith data is in the purview of science, not math. Teaching this is math class\nwill take time away from math if it is not being used to illustrate specific\nmathematical concepts, or taught only from probabilistic ideas.\nI am also concerned about the inclusion of environmental and social concerns in\nthe math curriculum. Certainly, problems of society and the environment make\nreasonable examples of math applications for students. However, having an\nexplicit goal of teaching EP&Cs in math class will necessarily compete with the\ngoal of teaching math in math class. I understand that the decision that\nenvironmental education should be interdisciplinary has been made years ago, in\na way unrelated to this framework, but environmental science certainly seems\nlike a subject which should be taught in a separate science class (which\nintegrates concepts learned in math class).\nThe framework suggests that 'rather than seeking only to understand whether\nstudents can accurately demonstrate algorithmic proficiency on a single problem\ntype, teachers hold a broader view of how students might demonstrate their\nmathematical knowledge and understanding.' This seems to be implying that if\nstudents are not able to apply algorithms properly, then teachers should change\ntheir standards and not require the algorithms. What is the purpose of teaching\nstudents math if they are unable to apply algorithms? The truth is that students\ndo not possess 'mathematical knowledge and understanding' if they cannot solve\nmath problems. It is true that it is beneficial to allow students to be creative\nand exploratory with the algorithms they use, but this is only possible when\nbase algorithms are understood and built upon. As it says on the next page of\nthe document, 'all students need to have a range of strategies and approaches\nfrom which to choose in solving problems, including, but not limited to, general\nmethods, standard algorithms, and procedures.' Therefore, standard algorithms\nshould be checked for understanding.\nI agree with the framework that 'an important aspect of this understanding is to\nrecognize the power that algorithms bring to problem solving: knowing only\nsingle-digit multiplication and addition facts, it is possible to compute any\nsum, difference, or product involving whole numbers or finite decimals.'",

    "Comments": "What a missed opportunity. Although I can tell the document has\nbeen revised, I do not see how this Framework will make an effective change to\nteaching practice. Any attempt to distill this document down will lead to\nmisapplications and myth-based instruction. Although there is little use in\nplaying 'what if', what would have happened if the committee had instead focused\non how to implement research practices that improve achievement in an engaging\nway instead of focusing solely on uplifting inquiry as the only way to ensure\nactive engagement? What if the CMF had been aligned with the IES Practice Guides\nfor teaching mathematics and provided teachers with evidence-based instructional\nstrategies and ways to implement them engagingly? Although the Common Core\nStandards and SMPs are indisputably important and useful ideas, the lack of a\ndistilled set of instructional principles (other than telling teachers to always\nuse rich, authentic tasks and center everything around student ideas) that\nteachers can put into practice is frustrating. Based on this revision, it seems\ninevitable that the impression that throwing students into authentic tasks is\nall that is needed for students to be engaged and learn, and that because\nstandards are assigned to a grade band, no one teacher is responsible for\nensuring students reach mastery on a concept, skill, or procedure. This,\nfrankly, is a recipe for continuous unfinished learning that is passed from\ngrade to grade. In addition, adopting the definition of 'fluency' that removes\nthe explicit final goal of 'retrieval from memory' is setting up kids for\ndifficulties, and the very anxiety in higher mathematics that the CFM is\nattempting to avoid. There is no question that the push to memorize procedures\nwithout ever teaching concepts was wrong. But the push to eliminate memorization\n\u2013 or at least downplay its importance to the extent you see it minimally\nmentioned only in an offhand way - is equally problematic. Although I appreciate\nthe revisions that have so far been made, I do not believe this document is\nready for release. (And frankly, there has hardly been any time at all to read\nand comment on this version!!) Others, like Brian Conrad, have pointed out\ncontinued misleading citations to research. And I am continually dismayed by the\nfocus on inquiry as the primary method of teaching, as well as the continued\ndenigration of any explicit, systematic instruction as 'passive' and 'lecture'\nand \u201clower-level teaching\u201d. Instead, they set up a false dichotomy between\nengagement and explicit instruction, and so it is no wonder the authors want the\nassessment processes to change. Based on prior research on the impact of inquiry\non achievement, the results of this Framework\u2019s implementations are not likely\nto be good. ",

    "Comments": "The CDE and SBE created a clever set up that creates the appearance\nof opening up the CMF for public comments while in practice it effectively runs\nthe general public out of time to provide feedback. The current version of the\nCMF that the SBE is about to vote on retained and carried over several\nsubstantive flaws from the prior CFM\u002fsecond field draft. These must be\ncorrected. Furthermore, CMF has been written under a process fraught with\nconflicts of interest. The CDE and SBE should hire external legal counsel to\nevaluate this issue to provide clearance and not rely on its internal counsel\nthat is biased to support internal processes. The current CMF cannot be approved\nin its current form and be allowed to influence math public education for 8\nyears.\n\nThe SBE should be up to date on current issues and perform its due diligence\nthat incorporates research and practical evidence that clearly illustrates that\nthe current proposals in CMF do not work. For example, CMF references in lines\n833-836 chapter 8 that data science is valid due to a UC BOARS policy resolution\non area C (October 2020). Recently, California State University passed an\nacademic senate resolution rejecting the UC policy (page 4, third full paragraph\nin the attached CSU 3599.PDF).\n\nPublic education in the state of California is funded by both state and federal\nfunding. The CDE effectively hired CMF writers employed by the owner of youcubed\ntrademark \u2013Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Education (GSE) department -\nthat sell teacher training into public schools on data science courses to write\na data science philosophy into the math framework where funding for public\neducation is coming both from state and federal resources. Organizational\nConflicts of Interest (OCI) in federal contracts requires that contractors who\nadvise on establishing criteria should not be writing their own criteria into\npolicies such that they can then turn around and sell their services funded by\ntaxpayer funds. Yet the CDE and SBE did exactly that. It has been made crystal\nclear by 442 California based STEM professors (attached), exclusively from 4\nyear colleges, INCLUDING 100 Stanford STEM professors (NOT part of Stanford\u2019s\nGraduate School of Education department) that these shallow data science courses\ndo not adhere to mathematical content standards and that data science is not a\nreplacement for Algebra II. Dr Jelani Nelson from UC Berkeley and Dr Brian\nConrad from Stanford are high profile advocates of the fact that there should be\na CONTENT STANDARD established for data science. What criteria should be used\nfor instructional materials? The CDE and SBE have made no efforts to establish\nobjective criteria. Instead, a select group of collaborators from UCLA and\nStanford\u2019s GSE during the CMF revision process over the last 3 years have been\ngiven a huge advantage over any competition (see attached emails). Education\npolicy at the state level should be based on unbiased, academic research.\nEnclosure: 94 page document",

    "Comments": "To: Members of the State Board of Education\n\nI support the adoption of the CA Mathematics Framework 2023. The framework\nfocuses on -\n\nIntegrated and Conceptual Understanding: The framework promotes an integrated\nand conceptual understanding of mathematics. Rather than focusing solely on\nprocedural fluency, it encourages students to develop a deep understanding of\nmathematical concepts and connections between different mathematical topics.\nThis approach helps students develop a solid foundation in math and fosters a\nlifelong love for the subject.\n\nProblem-solving and Application: The revised framework encourages students to\nengage in problem-solving activities and apply their mathematical knowledge to\nreal-world situations. Teachers, families, and partners support this aspect as\nit helps students see the relevance of math in their everyday lives and equips\nthem with problem-solving skills that are valuable beyond the classroom.\n\nCollaboration and Communication: The framework emphasizes the importance of\ncollaboration and communication in learning mathematics. It encourages students\nto work in groups, engage in mathematical discourse, and explain their thinking.\nThis collaborative approach fosters a supportive and inclusive learning\nenvironment and prepares students for future teamwork and communication in\nvarious settings\n\nRespectfully,\nAlvin Salgarino\nMiddle School Math Teacher ",

    "Comments": "Dear State Board of Education,\n\nI am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposed Mathematics\nFramework for California Public Schools and the very short period being provided\nfor public comment on this version of the framework.\n\nRegarding the comment time, I understand the public is being given less than 2\nweeks to comment, with a deadline of noon today--a deadline I'm barely meeting,\neven as someone who has done a lot of public-school advocacy the last few years.\nGiven the short time frame and scheduling of comments during the 4th of July\nholiday period, it seems likely that many people who would be interested in\ncommenting on such a major proposal won't even know about it in time. The CDE\nwebsite states that 60-day review periods were provided for comment on prior\nversions of the proposal (https:\u002f\u002fwww.cde.ca.gov\u002fci\u002fma\u002fcf\u002f), so why not provide\na similar time frame for review and comment on the latest version?\n\nRegarding the substance of the math framework, I am concerned that it is based\nlargely on ideological and personal views about teaching math and equity, rather\nthan on evidence-based practices and real-world behavior. As a parent of two\nkids in SFUSD, we have seen that efforts grounded in ideology, however\nwell-intentioned, have had harmful results, including in math. Just because you\nwant something to be true doesn't make it so.\n\nFor example, about 10 years ago, SFUSD, noting gaps between groups and the need\nfor equity, embarked on an ambitious plan to change how math is taught,\nincluding by removing algebra from 8th grade. The results of this experiment? It\nwas a failure, as SFUSD's Superintendent Matt Wayne has publicly acknowledged.\nIndeed, the gaps between groups grew even worse. Many families with more\nresources put their kids in private school or found workarounds such as tutoring\nand online classes to help their kids in math. And the most disadvantaged kids\ngot the short end of the stick yet again, with even less opportunity to learn,\nto be challenged, and to excel.\n\nWhat you do--what we choose to do as a society--affects real people. I am very\nconcerned by the framework's apparent reliance on many of Dr. Jo Boaler's\nrecommendations, as SFUSD's math overhaul was strongly influenced by Dr.\nBoaler's views--and failed. I urge you to rely on evidence-based practices--the\nthings we know work best--not 'one-size-fits-all' policies and approaches. We\nneed to try to meet each child where they are at and give them the opportunity\nto succeed. We are all different, we all have different strengths and\nweaknesses, and we can all benefit from being challenged--wherever we may be\nstarting from.\n\nThank you for considering my comments.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSupryia Ray",

    "Comments": "I am writing today as a San Francisco public school parent who\nstrongly opposes rushing through changes to the CA math framework. Similar\nchanges made to SFUSD's math framework have left students behind and unprepared\nfor college. Dumbing down and single-tracking math does not result in better\noutcomes for low-income students are students of color. It harms everyone. Also,\nfailing to focus math frameworks on MATH, not side issues like equity and the\nenvironment, means that students will learn less math. We must prepare our\nstudents for whatever comes next for them, and that means building a strong\nmathematics foundation for every child. Once they have strong foundations in\nmath, only then can students apply math more broadly in other areas.\n\nYou have rushed through a bad plan, and I am asking you to slow down and give\ntime for evaluation and meaningful comment. Our kids deserve that.\n\nThank you,\nMeg Kammerud\nSan Francisco",

    "Comments": "Revision of California Mathematics Framework.\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG\u2019s) highlight a commitment\nto bettering the lives of humans and the planet across seventeen (17) areas:\nrecognizing that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with\nstrategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur\neconomic growth. SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education\nand promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The State of California has\nfallen short with respect to SDG 4 in that many CA school districts, current\nteaching practices have resulted in only one-third of students scoring\nproficient in math on standardized measures across the state. Additionally, most\nstudents are being pushed out of high-level pathways at a young age. Math\neducation has been a gatekeeper to college and career success, preventing\nfirst-generation college-bound students, Black and Latino students, students\nwith disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to 4-year\ncolleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers. Mathematics instruction\nin California must be more effective and equitable. The revisions to the\nframework offer a better way to teach mathematics. Methods that are creative,\ninclusive, culturally responsive, challenging, and affirming for all students\nand that engage students more effectively. Strategies that have demonstrated\nresults in allowing students to make meaning, think critically, and progress at\ntheir own pace. Stand up for equity in education and for mathematics in\nparticular: approve the revisions. This is not only about civil rights and human\nrights, but relates to the national security of our country: educated youth.\n",

    "Comments": "As a current mathematics teacher in CA public schools, and a former\nstudent in the CA public education system, I am writing to express my support\nfor the proposed California Math Framework. The framework provides appropriate\nguidance for districts, schools, and teachers to implement the common core\nstandards for mathematics, placing a focus on diversity, equity, and deep\nunderstanding of mathematics.\nI am aware of numerous criticisms of the framework, and would like to speak to a\nfew of these criticisms and why I believe they should be taken with a grain of\nsalt when considering the goals for the future of California mathematics\neducation. Firstly, many criticisms rely on analysis and criticisms written by\nBrian Conrad of the Stanford Mathematics Department. I attended Stanford\nUniversity as an undergraduate in the late 2010s. During my time at Stanford,\nConrad was a professor and director of undergraduate studies. Unfortunately, my\nexperience with mathematics at Stanford revealed that the Stanford Math\nDepartment has no interest in increasing diversity, equity, or deep\nunderstanding of mathematics. I entered my freshman year as a high achieving\nmath student, excited about mathematics and potentially interested in a major,\nbut my first day of class made me feel alienated, incompetent, and discouraged.\nNot because I was truly unqualified, but because the professor made it clear\nthat asking questions would be interpreted as stupidity, that he expected the\nmajority of us to fail the class, and that mathematics was an elite field meant\nonly for some. Throughout my first year, I learned more about the math\ndepartment that only supported these initial impressions -- particularly that\nthere were nearly no faculty or lecturers who were women or people of color, and\nthat the department building had only recently installed its first women's\nrestroom. I chose to major in chemistry instead of mathematics so that I could\ncontinue exploring advanced mathematical ideas, but apart from the mathematics\ndepartment. I still maintain that had I attended a different university, I would\nhave likely majored in mathematics, but Stanford was not a welcoming place to do\nso. I bring my experience to your attention in order to underscore that though\nBrian Conrad may have interest in the subject, he has little to no authority to\nspeak on mathematics education, and within his own field of influence, he has\nbeen a part of creating a space that is antithetical to the goals of the CA math\nframework. I am sure that we do not want CA students to feel alienated,\nincompetent, and discouraged when experiencing math class, and I feel that the\nmath framework would allow us to move in a positive direction.\nAnother criticism of the framework relates to the framework's advice on limiting\ntracking and acceleration in mathematics. As both a teacher and mathematics\nstudent who experienced acceleration, I can speak to the extreme negative\neffects it can have, not only creating significant gaps in understanding, but\nalso causing students to 'burn out' on math, instead of fostering a love and joy\nthat can last throughout college and career. Specifically, some criticisms argue\nthat advice against acceleration are holding students back, and that prior to\ncommon core, all students used to take algebra in 8th grade, but now that is\npushed to high school. I personally took 'algebra' in 8th grade under the\nstandards preceding common core, and much of the 8th grade math curriculum under\ncommon core matches up with what was taught in 'algebra.' By contrast, the high\nschool Algebra curriculum under common core is much more rigorous and requires\nmuch deeper understanding and fluency of connections between ideas than what was\npreviously accepted. It is important for us as educators to focus on ensuring\nstudents have strong, interconnected and flexible understandings of mathematics\n- this is unfortunately lost when we allow for rampant acceleration. Because of\nthis, I appreciate the framework's advice on limiting acceleration and I am\nhopeful for how it will support schools and districts in creating pathways that\nprioritize students' deep understanding.\nI am thankful for the work that has gone into creating and revising the\nMathematics Framework over the past 3 years. I urge the board to adopt the\nframework so that we can move forward into implementing what is best for CA math\nstudents. ",

    "Comments": " Dear California State Board of Education,\nI am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)\nproposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in\nmath proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or\nadvanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF\nChp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have\nalso declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down\nfrom 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced\nin 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California\u2019s plans to remedy\nthis massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such\nas tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with\nstudents feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math.\nA simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this\nmath framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping\nkids feel good about math. The word \u201cidentity\u201d (in reference to building up\nstudents\u2019 math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times.\nThe word \u201cbelonging\u201d (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math\ncommunity) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students\nachieve math \u201cproficiency\u201d is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is\nagainst students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a\nconsequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the\nprimary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the\nover-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math\ncontent proficiency.\n\u25cf \u201cThis framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for\nstudents with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and\nfeel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community.\u201d (Ch. 2, Line 192)\n\u25cf \u201cBoth mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that\nteaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students\u2019\nperspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics\nthinkers.\u201d (Ch. 2, Line 462)\n\u25cf \u201cThis concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at\nthe pre-kindergarten level.\u201d (Ch 2, Line 467)\n\u25cf \u201cTeaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students\u2019\nbackgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense\nof belonging.\u201d (Ch 2, Line 499)\n\u25cf \u201cTeachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share\nautobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for\nstudents to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences.\u201d\n(Ch 2, Line 514)\n1\n\n\u25cf \u201cThey strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community.\u201d\n(Ch 2, Line 792)\n\u25cf \u201cA classroom that welcomes students\u2019 unfinished thinking normalizes\nmathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as\nbelonging to the discipline of mathematics.\u201d (Ch 2, Line 871)\n\u25cf \u201cThe aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is\nabout sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong.\u201d (Ch\n2, Line 988)\n\u25cf \u201cData investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of\nbelonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely\nrelevant to their lives.\u201d (Ch 5, Line 123)\n\u25cf \u201cEducators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing\nengaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with\ncontent.\u201d (Ch 5, Line 1400)\n\u25cf \u201cImportant principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer\nthe greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the\nfollowing:\n\u25cb Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages.\u201d (Ch 5, Line 1409)\n\u25cf \u201cThis framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences\nof all\ntheir students are positive \u201d(Ch 7 Line 68)\n\u25cf \u201cThe idea is for teachers to help students experience the \u201cwonder, joy, and\nbeauty of math\u201d (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students\ndevelop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners.\u201d (Ch 7,\nLine 72)\n\u25cf \u201cWhen students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can\ncome to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more\npositively.\u201d (Ch 2 line 164)\nAll stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math\npositively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a\nstate, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency,\neven if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The\nCMF advises teachers, \u201cDuring groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to\nelevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group,\nwhich is referred to as \u201cassigning competence\u201d. (Ch 12, line 244) What\nCalifornia needs is not \u201cassigned competence\u201d but \u201cactual competence\u201d which is\noften achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to\nlearn and succeed. The CMF further explains, \u201cWhen teachers perceive that a\nstudent has become \u201clow status\u201d in a group, they intervene by publicly praising\na mathematical contribution the student has made.\u201d (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot\nnearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a\nnice takeoff? Status\n2\n\nis often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected,\nnot because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past.\nThe CMF continues in this vein, writing \u201cbut grouping by perceived \u201cability\u201d can\nbe the first step in a system of tracking if \u201csimilar ability\u201d students are\ngrouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs\nabout who is capable\u2014as when groups are intentionally stratified according to\nperceived \u201cability\u201d so that students soon understand who is the \u201chigh kid\u201d and\nwho is the \u201clow kid\u201d in the group. Aside from language development\nconsiderations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey\nto each student that everyone has something to offer the group\u2019s learning and\nsomething to learn from the thoughts of others.\u201d (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know\nwho the \u201chigh kids\u201d are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special\ngroup. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the\nauthors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners\u2019\nacceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of\ncourse putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most\ncapable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient;\neveryone knows that! Let\u2019s not hide that and pretend all students are on equal\nfooting; rather, let\u2019s put struggling students into groups and provide extra\nsupport so they CAN become proficient.\nIn addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of\nachieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious\nas other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence)\n\u201cStudents also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the\nmemorization of meaningless formulas\u2014perhaps because they see no relevance for\ntheir learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning\nmathematics.\u201d (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn\u2019t it possible that some self-select out of\nmath when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students\nself-select out of (even if it\u2019s fun and engaging), such as little league, boy\nscouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, \u201cOther research examines\nbeliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant\nto personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe\ndrop off in utility value during high school.\u201d (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many\nthings we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what\nhappened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and\nperhaps you\u2019ll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students\ndon\u2019t care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the\nmath behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life.\nThe state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what\nstudents MUST learn, whether or not they see \u201cutility\u201d in it. The same is true\nin reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF\nneeds to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so\nconcerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of\nmath education- to learn math!\nIn addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem,\nthe CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12\nLine 854 reads, \u201cSummative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing\nfor students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging\neffects.\u201d Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is\nthe CMF preparing students for? A world where they are\n3\n\nnot competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say\nor do at all so they feel good about themselves?\nCalifornia is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency,\nespecially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need\nof rigorous and proven methods that focus on students\u2019 math proficiency levels;\nrather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more\nconcerned with how students feel about math, helping them \u201cbelong\u201d to the math\ncommunity (whatever that means), and helping them develop a \u201cpositive math\nidentity\u201d. Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the\n2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning,\nteaching and assessment as its primary focus.\n4\n",

It is essential that California\nlead the way in rejecting the polarization of mathematics education that is\ncurrently gripping national politics. While it is true that any educational\nmaterials are political to some degree, let us not fall into the pitfall that\nclaims that good math teaching and learning is somehow at the far extreme of a\nleftist agenda. Further, it would be ignorant to think that any framework that\nsupports the education of all students is somehow limiting the success of some\nstudents. Talk to any public crowd at a grocery store and ask them how they\nliked their math education and you\u2019re likely to hear someone say, \u201cI\u2019m not a\nmath person.\u201d We have to change this narrative. This framework makes strides to\nhelp students and teachers realize that everyone is a math person and anyone can\nlearn math. The inclusion of data science is exciting and forward looking. The\nemphasis on multiple strategies, representations, and open ended tasks is based\non research for what works best for students. As a district teacher of the year,\nand 25 year veteran with 5 years experience in specialized math instructional\ncoaching, I urge you to please adopt this framework.\n",

All\nmention of that UC policy must be removed, and line 813-824 of Chapter 8 that is\ndelusional nonsense.\n\nChapter 1, lines 174-187, (Luculano et al., 2015) (really Iuculano) is still\ndishonestly invoked for a ``brain connections'' narrative.\n\nChapter 1, lines 192-197 (Lambert and Sugita, 2016) on learning disabilities\n(falsely ``learning differences'' in the CMF) and (Freiman, 2018) on\nhigh-achieving students are absurdly said to often be about ``the same\nstudents''.\n\nChapter 2, lines 475-8, (Esmonde, Caswell, 2010) is still described in\nmisleading ways.\n\nChapter 3, lines 480-2 and Chapter 6, lines 1550-2, cite (Carpenter 1997) to\njustify guidance about ``invented strategies'' but it was not a controlled\nexperiment in teaching methods and says its conclusions ``cannot be generalized\nto all students.'' Remove this and all text it is used to support.\n\nChapter 6, lines 414-8, (Sengupta-Irving and Enyedy, 2014) is falsely said to\nshow``an instructional approach focused on mathematical practices may be\nimportant in supporting student achievement on curricular standards and\nassessments''; the control and experimental groups improved equivalently on\nassessments!\n\nChapter 8, lines 641-657 still substantially distorts (Liang et al., 2012) and\n(Domina et al., 2015).\n\nChapter 8, lines 894-907 still falsely claims to list student competencies.\n\nChapter 9, lines 145-155 promotes an anti-tracking narrative with the same\ncitation misrepresentation as before.\n\nChapter 9, lines 156-192 opposes 8th-grade Algebra I based on an unpublished\n2021 paper with major design flaws (akin to high school baseball players joining\nan 8th grade team: the improvement in performance implies nothing). Remove all\ncitations of this and everything that rests on it.\n\nChapter 12, lines 769-771 still dishonestly cites (Brookhart et al., 2016).\n\nCited documents are missing from the bibliography: (Siegler et al., 2010),\n(Fischer et al., 2019), (Burris, Heubert, Levin 2006).\n\nIn Appendix A, remove the useless summary in first half (before line 208) so the\nrest is more visible to teachers and parents.\n",

    "Comments": "\nSeeing that 'data science' is advocated in the CMF as replacing Algebra 2, as a\npracticing engineer (I invented Shazam), I use Algebra 2 concepts EVERY DAY.\nThey are fundamental to engineering. I am baffled by public comments, videos,\nand publications in which Boaler disparages Algebra 2 as 'outdated'. In a video,\nshe specifically derides synthetic division. Synthetic division is used in\ninfinite impulse response recursive filters in almost EVERY modern digital\nsignal processing device. This includes speakers, microphones, AirPods, smart\nphones, WiFi, cable data, and more. Abstract forms of it are used in encryption\nand error correcting codes. They are computed millions of times per second, in\nyour hands, ears, car, etc. Every time you use AirPods, drive a modern car, make\na phone call, send an email, think of synthetic division. It is irresponsible to\ndownplay the extremely relevant and fundamental set of mathematical techniques\nand tools whose fundamentals are taught in Algebra 2. If anything, the use and\nreliance of modern technology on Algebra 2 is increasing. It is not outdated. It\nis even fun: synthetically divide 1\u002f(x^2-x-1) and you get the Fibonacci series.\n\nHow can the CDE, an agency entrusted with ensuring that CA and the USA, be\nadvocating a dead-end path to competitiveness in a world-wide market for\nengineers? In Silicon Valley, we hire engineers and scientists from other\ncountries because we have a shortage of STEM-trained students. At Stanford, in\nthe physics department, an observation was that US-born and very smart physics\nmajors had to drop out of the program because they did not have enough math\npreparation vs their foreign peers.\n\nA very recent article in the Chronicles of Higher Education suggests that the\nData Science approval as satisfying a UC(c) requirement might be retracted:\n'Now, some members appear to be rethinking it. At BOARS committee meetings in\nMarch and April, representatives for the Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles,\nMerced, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz campuses all voiced concerns\nabout math preparation, minutes show. At one point, \u201cmembers suggested that the\nprevious BOARS\u2019 decision may have been rushed.\u201d\nA group of Black UC faculty members in data science-related fields sent a letter\nto the committee in May. \u201cIntroduction to Data Science\u201d and courses like it,\nthey wrote, \u201cmake claims that they specifically support learning for women and\nminorities, which are not only baseless, but fail to appreciate that they\nactually do the opposite and harm students from such groups by steering them\naway from being prepared for STEM majors.\u201d And the chair of Santa Barbara\u2019s\nmechanical-engineering department wrote to express \u201cour strongest support for\nkeeping Algebra 2 as a core requirement,\u201d as it \u201cteaches concepts which are\nabsolutely essential for our undergraduate students to succeed in our program.\u201d\n\nPlease do not ram this through for approval. It is irresponsible to further\nweaken our students' competitiveness on a worldwide market for talent.\n",

    "Comments": "Dear Trustees,\n\nThe Carlsbad Education Alliance (CEA) is a coalition of parents, students and\nstaff in the Carlsbad Unified School District committed to transparency,\naccountability and academic excellence. CEA opposes the new Mathematics\nFramework developed by the California Department of Education (CDE),\nInstructional Quality Commission (IQC), and State Board of Education (SBE). The\nCDE website states that this framework will provide \u201c...guidance designed to\nhelp educators align classroom teaching with California\u2019s rigorous math learning\nstandards.\u201d Yet, the rigorous standards referred to by the CDE have failed to\nproduce passing scores on national standardized math tests taken by California\nstudents, and California continues to rank in the bottom quartile. Additionally,\non California\u2019s own Smarter Balanced state assessment, only 33% of students met\nor exceeded math proficiency standards last year. This is a failure on every\nlevel for California\u2019s students.\n\nThe newly proposed Mathematics Framework should focus solely on teaching math.\nTime and instruction on side issues like identity, equity and social justice do\nnot have a place in California\u2019s failing math curriculum. Those topics will not\nimprove scores on state-wide and nation-wide standardized tests. As educators,\nit is your job to advise and implement instruction based on proven techniques\nand facts, not theories and ideologies that are untested and unproven in\nreputable journals or publications.\n\nWe urge you to do better for California\u2019s students. Reject any and all\ncomponents of the framework that do not solely contribute to creating a\ncurriculum that will enable the majority of our students to pass standardized\nstate and national tests. It\u2019s quite simple. Just teach math.\n",

The pursuit of this goal\nhas nothing to do with social or political views, nor why students are where\nthey are.\nCalifornia must ratify a Math framework that offers all students the ability -\nirrespective of their abilities and aptitudes - to learn and be challenged if\nthey so desire, up to and including Calculus in high school.\nProfessor Boaler's political and social views have grossly overshadowed the\npursuit of this goal, and I hope the officials in charge of this process see\nthat, and hit the reset button.

    "Comments": "REJECT CMF 3.0. Acceleration during high school when college\nacceptance is meticulously dependent on grades???? How is that good for mental\nhealth? How does that protect against math anxiety??? We need students to be\nallowed to accelerate in middle school when grades don't matter and they can\nfind themselves and experiment. The approach to acceleration in this CMF is\ndevastating to anyone not in private schools (paying 50-60K\u002fyear) or who does\nnot provide external tutoring and classes for students to compensate for this\nterrible public math education. The idea that restricting acceleration in math\nto high school to reach Advanced Placement Calculus in this CMF is HORRIBLE for\nmental health! During high school, students who did NOT get external tutoring in\nmiddle school will be compared to kids who did. In our district in Palo Alto\nmany parents (including school board members) send their kids to private school\nduring middle school when that delaning experiment was implemented just before\nthe pandemic. Then they come back with all their enrichment and are compared to\nthe parents who trusted public education to prepare their kids. Students also\nreceive a lot of pressure to down-lane. It's destructive. Competition to get\ninto college engineering programs is FIERCE and anyone who doesn't have AP\ncalculus in high school has no chance, particularly if they don't have straight\nA's and 5's on their AP Calculus exam. The Data Science class is a pathway to a\ndead end and a signal to colleges that this student is not serious about STEM\nand yet this CMF emphasizes it. It's like a prize for participation designed to\nmake students feel good but everyone knows it is useless. Get a STEM\nprofessional and a math professor like Brian Conrad on this writing team and\nLISTEN to what he says!!! Or go back to the 2013 Framework. Students are not\nwidgets. They are individuals and need to be placed in classrooms that are right\nfor what they need, not in some heterogeneous class that serves no one. Families\nneed to be respected and told the truth about what successful preparation for\nSTEM is. Stop sending us the useless CMF once and for all and throw this CMF\nversion out!!! ",

The school district boundary divides a block of 4 homes into 2.\nThe boundary is not a cross street\u002fend of a street, but a fence dividing\nneighbors from each other.Fences are meant as property lines not isolating\nchildren from those a few doors down.\n\nOur children are growing up in the OGSD Community as their\nneighborhood\u002fcommunity. This is where we live and interact. COVID years were\nvery tough on everyone but particularly difficult on young children. Our\nchildren went through significant anxiety issues. Being forced to go to the\nassigned schools of SJUSD would only make psychological issues worse.The\nassigned schools are located within 3 separate communities, none of which are\nwalkable and would remove the children from their neighborhood peers & friends.\n\nThe interdistrict transfer process is there but it is inconsistent, unreliable\nand leads to uncertainty as:\n1.The transfer process is a criteria based annual application with no guarantee\nof admission year to year. Our eligibility criteria is employment based and is\nonly valid for children K-5, with no established criteria for gr 6-12 &\nemployment is never guaranteed. How do we plan for 6-12?\n2. The application status is unknown until June & July making it impossible to\nplan for after school care\u002factivity, as this enrollment happens prior to June.\n3. Transfer students are at a disadvantage.They fail to meet resident criteria\nfor any special district programs because they will only be considered after\nresident students.\n\nOur application meets all the 9 technical criteria for a territory transfer and\nwas supported by the SCC Office of Education.It\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fEducation.It__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!ZnGp-S6ACy7EGiNg8Gfqh9lVvmRTmI2A62oOYPNaQCFdz-V9I3agl7_bEd7sqoeZ20XP3yFGsyPTs7ulyaU$]\nwould be unfair and disheartening to base a decision without considering all the\nvariables that have changed since the boundary was created.\n\nHaving familiarity with their surroundings & community provides children a safe\nspace.Student & parent involvement occurs naturally and spontaneously when you\nreside within the same community as your schools.It\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fschools.It__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!ZnGp-S6ACy7EGiNg8Gfqh9lVvmRTmI2A62oOYPNaQCFdz-V9I3agl7_bEd7sqoeZ20XP3yFGsyPT_BjVvvA$]\nwould be devastating if this was taken away.We would never be able to feel the\nsame connection with any of the allocated schools as they are not a part of the\nneighborhood in which we reside & are located within 3 separate communities.We\nask for certainty, consistency, and reliability. We should not be discriminated\nagainst because of which side of the fence our property lies.\n\nWe are asking that children and their best interest be prioritized, and the\npolitics of outdated boundaries not interfere with what is right for children\ngrowing up within the OGSD & ESUHSD neighborhood.If approved, all 3 of the\nschools we would attend, without any uncertainty, would be within walking\ndistance on safe neighborhood streets.\n\nWe hope you take this unique & bizarre boundary situation passing through the\nmiddle of our homes into account when making your decision. Please allow these\nchildren to continue thriving in the community where they reside.\n",

    "Comments": "As a teacher, mother of two intellectually gifted (one highly\ngifted) children, and a gate coordinator, I am aware that not all students who\ntake accelerated math classes benefit from the experience. However, my own two\nchildren have thrived accelerating in math. I made my 15 year old wait to\naccelerate until 7th grade and he has thrived and is more motivated in his math\nclasses since accelerating as he is challenged and moving at a pace that matches\nhis academic needs. My 12 year old accelerated in 6th grade and is scoring over\n100% in math. I only let him accelerate by taking a course that covers 6th and\n7th grade standards in one year and he has thrived. Being in an accelerated\nhighly gifted magnet has motivated and challenged him in ways the \u201cgeneral\u201d\ngrade level classes were not. I do see that skipping years of math can be\nproblematic for the general population of students, but for those who clearly\nhave mastered grade level standards should not be slowed down or held back\nbecause of \u201cnew standards rules\u201d. Students do not learn at the same pace and\nshould be allowed to take math classes that meet their individual needs. ",

    "Comments": "I am a mathematician (BA with distinction from University of\nPennsylvania). Part of my doctoral research involved analyzing active learning\nmethods for teaching introductory calculus to undergraduates. I tutored,\nmentored and taught Philadelphia magnet, traditional, and charter public school\nstudents of all ages throughout my 10 years in that city.\n\nI am also a father of one deeply committed to public education. The stated goals\nof the new math framework are laudable, but the methods will frankly not achieve\nthose goals, and in the process will irreparably harm the schooling of millions\nof Californian public school children. Tens or hundreds of thousands more will\nbe driven away from the public school system, leaving those who remain in public\nschools even further behind.\n\nDr. Boaler's work is the bedrock of this framework. She is cited 28 times, more\nthan any other but the CA DoE itself, and 4x more than any other single human\nauthor. To rely so heavily on the work of a Nobel Laureate would be\nquestionable; to do so for an author whose work is so highly controversial is\nplain irresponsible.\n\nGo back to the drawing board and start by involving a wider spectrum of voices\ninto the curriculum design process, or risk undermining the future of public\neducation in California.",

As a member of the team\nof writers hired to help the CFCC put ideas into language, I got a good\nappreciation for the thought and care that went into the emphases they chose for\nthe Framework.\n\nThe proposed Framework represents an excellent step forward, as we learn from 13\nyears of experience with the California Common Core Standards in Mathematics.\nFocusing instruction around the standards' big ideas, and helping students\nexperience math from a place of curiosity and connection, will go a long way\ntowards substantially increasing the group of students who enter college as\ncompetent, confident math (and more broadly STEM) enthusiasts.",

    "Comments": "It was brought to my attention that the State Framework for Math\nhas not had thorough research completed, only 1 research paper was examined, nor\nhas the Framework had many relevant changes made. The math scores for the\nstudents in the State of CA have not increased with any consistency since it's\nlast update. The framework has created testing requirements that are more of a\nchallenge in the recent years. As we are seeing more efforts to bring younger\nstudents into the educational setting along with an increase of students needing\nspecialized academic learning services, I believe more research into best\npractices for the teaching of younger students and students with disabilities\nneeds to be addressed. If the continuation of pushing down of age appropriate\nstandards to younger students continue, I fear we will have more students\nstruggling with math.\nThank you,\nMerriellen Cohrs, Ed. D",

Statewide SB assessment confirmed that\nsubstantial achievement gaps exist, which becomes a concern because schools are\noriented for mathematical understanding for college and career preparedness.\nThis situation is addressed by the 2023 CA Math Framework as recommended by the\nCalifornia Department of Education (CDE). It supports students and teachers and\npromotes effective teaching and learning. It ensures the progression of\nmathematical understanding of students and supports culturally diverse learners,\nEL, and students with disability with instructional practices. All these are the\nreasons to support the 2023 CA Math Framework. ",

Each and every student might not choose to pursue a STEM\ndegree, but each and every student should have the opportunity to complete all\nthe math up to in including high school calculus as well as probability and\nstatistics standards. The Framework falls short of describing easily accessible\npathways to Calculus and Statistics. Figure 8-4 exemplifies my point: (my\ncomment including the figure is attached)\n\nWhere is the clear and accessible path to completing foundational math and\nCalculus and Statistics?\n\nMy district, San Francisco Unified (SFUSD), struggled with implementing Common\nCore Math and providing easily accessible pathways to the foundational math\nthrough Calculus. SFUSD created two options: an inaccessible for all pathway and\nan \u201cantithetical\u201d compression course pathway.\n\nMake no mistake: those with resources found workarounds to SFUSD\u2019s pathways and\nwill find workarounds to this Framework. I\u2019m writing on behalf of those with\nlimited access to resources.\n\nThe Framework needs to identify a clear and accessible path for all students\ndesiring to complete all the Common Core Math standards (including Calculus and\nStatistics). As currently written, the Framework fails to do so.\n",

    "Comments": "I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised\nDraft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. I completely agree with\nTom Loveless' comments on the revised draft of the CMF. He said:\n\nI write this letter to oppose the proposed California Math Framework. My\ncomments are a distillation of a lengthier analysis presented in the Spring 2023\nissue of Education Next, 'California's New Math Framework Doesn't Add Up.'\n\nThe framework\u2019s stated purpose is \u201cto support implementation of the California\nCommon Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM).\u201d The framework\nundermines the standards, in some cases directly contradicting them.\n\nThe framework states: \u201cAttaining fluency with multiplication and division within\n100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students\u2019 work.\u201d How\ncan that be? If students know multiplication facts \u201cfrom memory\u201d at the end of\nthird grade\u2014as stipulated in the state standards--why would they still be\nworking on basic fact fluency in the upper elementary grades? But the claim is\nrepeated: \u201cAcquiring fluency with multiplication facts begins in third grade and\ndevelopment continues in grades four and five.\u201d (pg. 83)\n\nNote that California\u2019s 2013 math framework contained almost the exact same\nwording to describe third grade expectations. \u201cMultiplication and division are\nnew concepts in grade three, and reaching fluency with these operations within\n100 represents a major portion of students\u2019 work. By the end of grade three,\nstudents also know all products of two one-digit numbers from memory (3.OA.7 ).\u201d\nA major portion of 3rd grade work will now become a major portion of the work in\nupper elementary grades. What a step backwards!\n\nWhat does fluent mean? The 2013 framework offers a clear definition, consistent\nwith other states that adopted Common Core. \u201cThe word fluent is used in the\nstandards to mean \u2018reasonably fast and accurate\u2019 and possessing the ability to\nuse certain facts and procedures with enough facility that using such knowledge\ndoes not slow down or derail the problem solver as he or she works on more\ncomplex problems.\u201d The new framework redefines fluency to discourage an emphasis\non speed.\n\nThe California Common Core Math Standards call for students to demonstrate an\nunderstanding of, and the ability to use, the standard algorithms of addition\nand subtraction by the end of fourth grade, multiplication by the end of fifth\ngrade, and division by the end of sixth grade. These are culminating standards,\nnot ironclad rules regarding when standard algorithms can and cannot be taught.\n\nThe proposed math framework interprets these standards as banning the teaching\nof standard algorithms before the culminating grade, a false interpretation\nexplicitly debunked by Jason Zimba, one of the Common Core co-authors. If this\nframework is adopted, California\u2019s students will encounter the standard division\nalgorithm for the first time in sixth grade, years after most of the world has\nattained mastery.\n\nPlease reject the proposed framework.\n",

I will only add Math\nstandards ought to be raised and kept high for students to ensure our students\nare the best prepared in the world. It's the only way we will continue to\ncompete against our adversaries like Russia and China and remain the leading\neconomic, military, and intellectual superpower that we currently are. If\nstudents from California public schools enter a Cal State or UC unprepared for\nthe rigors of the coursework because of lowered math standards, their\neducational system has failed them, not helped them. Additionally, some students\nmay not be particularly good at math but may still be intellectually gifted and\nextremely talented in other fields of study. Lowering math standards does not\nhelp those students, it only has potential to distract them. That's because a\nstudent like that should see high math standards, recognize advanced math may\nnot be their forte, and have the opportunity to pursue other equally rigorous\nand academically challenging paths instead where their talents will lie. Thank\nyou for consideration of my comments.",

A solid foundation in\nK-3 means that children know their facts in all areas: addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division FIRST!!! With this in place, the implementation of\nhigher concepts is attainable and with fewer errors in basic math issues in the\nupper grades. This can be achieved while incorporating critical thinking skills\nand building a life long interest in mathematics. \u201cHands on Algebra\u201din the early\nyears (3-5) is a game changer in order to promote a zest for math and take the\nfear out of the subject for many students. Pay attention to what successful\nstudents know and why they are stars in class. They have a solid foundation by\nthe end of 3rd grade and easily advance to higher math by 6th grade.

There is no need to call for race and sexual preference\nin Math for homework (Line 778).\n2) Overall the proposal will widen the gap between families with resources (who\ncan afford extra classes to complement Math education) versus families w\u002fo\nresources. We can even refer to the Governor of California, his four kids are\nattending private school which provides extra resources and advanced classes vs\npublic schools..\n3) K-12 is to give building blocks and a strong foundation. California kids will\nbe in disadvantage comparing to kids from other countries. A mediocre child from\nChina probably knows more Math than a medium student from California,\n4) Line 318-320 Charts - why the scales are different and why there are less\nstudents on Figure 9.2?\n\n\u201cIf you put the federal (in this case the state) government in charge of the\nSahara Desert, in five years there'd be a shortage of sand.\u201d\nIt seems that the same applies to Education.

To have a STEM (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need\nstudents with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses\n(such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and\nsuccess into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best,\nunclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes\nin the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to\naccelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the\nCMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek\nmath acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system,\nleaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged\npeers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade\nlevel with limited options to better their situation through STEM.",

    "Comments": "I write in opposition of the third field review of the California\nMathematics Framework (CMF). While the third draft of the CMF shows some\nimprovement over the second field review, primarily the removal of the\nMathematics: Investigating and Connecting (MIC) pathway as a third proposed\npathway in chapter 8, the overall document retains too many of the problems\npresent in the first and second drafts to be salvageable.\n\nAs to the issues that persist with the third field review of the CMF that make\nit unsalvageable:\n\n- While acknowledging the failings of California's public schools on the whole\nin providing minimal mathematics instruction to its students, the CMF merely\nasserts that the solution is to adopt the CMF writers' preferred instructional\napproaches. There is a large body of research and experience that indicates\nalternative approaches would better close math achievement gaps and improve\nmathematics instruction.\n\n- The lead writer of the CMF writing team -- Jo Boaler -- had a conflict of\ninterest because much of the 'research' cited to support the authors' claims,\nparticularly with regard to detracking, as well as approaches recommended come\nfrom her own for-profit organization - YouCubed.org\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fYouCubed.org__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!ffOThZtjZ6QKlo8imzM6BLCiFJTgsaLW8bRZnpL2UlGfHdQ7QYC-z4W7eWJEyUelAkb_Z02jSXxU8242aDc$].\nBoaler earns substantial income consulting with CA public school districts\nadvising on mathematics curricular changes.\n\n- The CMF is an overly political document that focuses on equity from the first\nchapter. Chapter 1 states, 'Reflecting the state\u2019s commitment to equity, every\nchapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to\nhelp mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.'\nTwo entire chapters -- 2 and 9 -- are devoted exclusively to equity as the\nauthors define it. That understanding of 'equity' can be gleaned from the\nGlossary in chapter 14 of the CMF:\n\n'Equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness. Drawing from\nGutierrez (2012), equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1)\nAccess to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes\nand success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4)\nAttention to relations of power.'\n\nThe third and fourth dimensions of 'equity' are by the author's own admission in\nher 2012 paper rooted in critical theory. A curriculum framework should not\ncontain a political orientation or political recommendations.\n\n- The instructional recommendations recommended in the CMF are poorly supported,\nignore research that supports competing recommendations, and are often justified\nby dubious research or questionable summarizations of the research cited. This\nis tacitly acknowledged by the WestEd researchers hired to write the third field\nreview as they removed references to San Francisco Unified School District's\nfailed policy of delaying Algebra 1 to 9th grade, yet claims continue to be made\nbased on those references.\n\n- If the instructional and policy recommendations in the CMF are followed by\nCalifornia school district's, it is my informed opinion that California K-12\nstudents' achievements in mathematics will continue to decline. The first\nchapter of the CMF says it is 'centered around the investigation of big ideas in\nmathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and\ntaught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs.' This focus on\nbig ideas, connection to 'authentic' student contexts, and vague notions of\n'multidimensional ways' rooted in UDL will necessarily reduce instructional time\nin development of basic mathematical skills.",

I've seen\nfirst-hand how much difference in student outcomes it makes to use culturally\nresponsive and equitable practices with our most vulnerable students. Math\nsuccess is not only important in the lives of the individuals we serve, but also\nfor our community at large. The future of the California economy and quality of\nlife for everyone in our state depends on the quality of Mathematics instruction\nof ALL students in public education today, not just some students. This 2023\nrevised framework gives schools the guidance necessary to produce positive\noutcomes for every student based on well-established research and field\nexperience. If the pedagogy described in the framework enhances the mathematical\nsuccess of all students, how can we NOT use it? I support the adoption of the\n2023 Mathematics Framework wholeheartedly because I believe in our students and\nI believe in our educators to meet the important challenge of educating every\nstudent, no matter who they are.",

    "Comments": "Dear Members of the CA State Board of Education:\n\nThe leadership team at Loyola Marymount University\u2019s Center for Equity for\nEnglish Learners extends its appreciation for the diligent work and efforts of\nthe committee and the writers responsible for the revision of the Mathematics\nFramework. We commend the Instructional Quality Commission and members of the\nCFCC for drafting a Framework that centers equity and engagement in California\u2019s\nvision of excellence in mathematics education.\n\nWe are writing regarding Agenda Item 11: Adoption of the 2023 CA Mathematics\nFramework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve\n\nThe Math Framework is a critical resource that can provide guidance on\nmathematics instruction centered around equity and access, including the\nspecific needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students in California.\n\nDuring the last review cycles, CEEL has partnered with several organizations to\nlead advocacy efforts for equity and access in our joint focus on English\nLearners. As such, CEEL co-signed letters submitted by Californians Together and\nother organizations. Collectively, we have included comments and suggestions to\nrecommend that chapters incorporate relevant pedagogical practices framed within\nprinciples of equity and access for English Learners and traditionally\nmarginalized groups of students.\n\nOur goal has been to ensure that the revised Mathematics Framework provides\nguidance to ensure greater rigor, relevance, and access for all of California\u2019s\nstudents, with a particular focus on the students who are most underserved in\nmathematics.\n\nTeachers need high-quality instructional guidance, support, and materials now,\nto engage all students effectively and equitably in mathematics learning. We\nrespectfully encourage the SBE to continue moving forward in the recommendation\nof revisions that deepen and strengthen the explicit equity focus in support of\nall learners including Multilingual\u002fEnglish Learners.\n\nTherefore, we urge the State Board of Education to consider the recommendations\nincluded in the attached document and to adopt the revised framework at its July\n2023 meeting so that the instructional materials adoption process can commence\nand so that teachers and school leaders can begin to learn about and implement\nthe framework.\n\nAttached, we respectfully include the LMU-CEEL\u2019s statement to the CA SBE. We\ncontinue to offer our support and respectfully reaffirm our comments and\nsuggestions focused on key recommendations for chapters 2, 12, and 13.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMagaly Lavadenz, Ph.D.\nLeavey Presidential Endowed Chair in Moral and Ethical Leadership & Executive\nDirector,\nCenter for Equity for English Learners\n\nElvira G. Armas, Ed.D.\nDirector, Center for Equity for English Learners (CEEL)\nAffiliated Faculty, Department of Educational Leadership\n\nVeronica Torres McLane\nAssistant Director for Professional Learning,\nCenter for Equity for English Learners (CEEL)\n",

    "StanceontheMatter": "Oppose",
    "Comments": "I completely agree with Mike Lawler's comments on the CMF. He said:\n\nThe prior drafts of the CMF had serious problems with accurate and appropriate\nreferences. Claims that have been removed from prior drafts include:\n(i) The repeat rate in San Francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to\n9th grade fell from 40% to 8%, and\n(ii) Most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math.\n\nProblems with references continue with this draft. My recommendation is that all\nreferences that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either\nremoved or replaced with proper references. If they cannot be replaced, the\nitems in the CMF that depend on the nonacademic references need to be removed,\ntoo. I'll provide two examples of non-academic references below that should be\nremoved, but these are just two examples to make the point clear. All of the\nnon-academic references need to be examined carefully by the California\nDepartment of Education.\n\nFor example, the Boaler, Munson, and Williams reference from Youcubed - What is\nMathematical Beauty- is not academic research and ends with an advertisement for\nbooks written by the authors. As Boaler is also an author of the CMF, having a\nreference advertising her books included in the CMF is inappropriate.\n\nA second example is the Boaler and Foster paper on Youcubed - Raisin~\nExpectations and Achievement. Again, this is not academic research. The paper\nhas a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the CMF as political. It\nis inappropriate to have a reference in the CMF criticizing opposition to the\nCMF. This paper also discusses a study - referred to as 'study 2' in the paper -\nthat compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015. This\ncomparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student\nachievement from a score difference on an Algebra II test one year and an 8th\ngrade math test in the next year. This reference to the study in this paper in\nChapter 9 of the CMF goes even farther to state (without reference or\nexplanation) that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling.\n\nThe claims about 'study 2' in chapter 9 of the CMF are an example of important\nclaims in the CMF (in this case, tracking) that are not backed by published\nacademic research. Again, this reference - and all non-academic research cited\nin the CMF - needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic\nresearch. As this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015, there\nhas been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores. If the only\ndiscussion of these exam scores is the post on Youcubed, this reference and the\ndiscussion about tracking supported by it, needs to be removed.\n\nThere are millions of students in California whose lives will be affected by the\nCMF It is the responsibility of the California Department of Education to ensure\nthat the Ideas In the document are supported properly. Non academic work like\nblog posts, books, or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as\nacademic work. The inclusion of advertisements and political statements about\nopposition are obviously not appropriate references. Non-academic studies cannot\nbe central to the CMF's proposal either.\n\nOnce the references are corrected (or the material removed), what remains in the\nCMF can be evaluated properly.",

    "Comments": "Dear State Board of Education Members,\n\nI have concerns with the current mathematics framework, and would recommend\nadditional emphasis on offering accelerated mathematics tracks for any\nCalifornia middle- or high-school students with sufficient aptitude and desire\nto enroll.\n\nI am writing as a private citizen and professional engineer. Accelerated math\ntracks, specifically algebra in middle school and pre-calculus + calculus in\nhigh school, were essential preparation for me when I enrolled in my core\nundergraduate math courses. Even with a strong foundation, it was challenging to\nkeep up with peers as we quickly moved through matrix algebra, integral +\ndifferential calculus, and statistics in our first year. This mathematical\ntraining was foundational for our future careers; I am currently at a materials\ncompany developing next generation components for lithium ion batteries. I can\ndirectly trace how my mathematics training supported my decision to enter a STEM\nfield, and to participate in an innovative business located here in California.\n\nIt's not fair or equitable to take away accelerated math tracks from public\nschool students. By watering down or eliminating accelerated math tracks in\nCalifornia public schools, the current framework makes it difficult for our\nstudents to thrive in STEM careers. In fact, I'm concerned it will exacerbate\ninequality, making it harder for our public school students to access advanced\nmath training.\n\nPlease consider placing additional emphasis on accelerated or honors classes in\nthe adopted math framework. Instructors such as Professor Conrad at Stanford\nUniversity have provided more specific recommendations on ways to improve the\ncurrent framework; I'd encourage the Board to adopt them:\nhttps:\u002f\u002fsites.google.com\u002fview\u002fpubliccommentsonthecmf\u002f\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__https:\u002f\u002fsites.google.com\u002fview\u002fpubliccommentsonthecmf\u002f__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YHOG3G4PI3xgCRmkFbzb8-ipxi-MoTU2_Vi6hvA8E2PIoYBXujDfsqDFZjnA2Aw4a-JZQBY0-LelOvfJ9g$]\n\nKind Regards,\nWilliam",

    "Comments": "The new math framework is a step towards creating more access and\nopportunity for students to develop mathematical thinking and problem solving.\nCurrent neuroscience research shows that all students have the ability to learn\nand grow given strong instruction and learning opportunities. The way this\nframework is set up gives teachers the ability to provide students of diverse\nskill and backgrounds entry points for learning and no limits to their learning\ntrajectory. As an educator, I want students to be able to come into the\nclassroom and meet their needs. It moves away from the outdated ideas that only\ncertain students are \u201cmath gifted\u201d or have \u201cmath brains\u201d. This is an important\nway for Califorina to invest in all of our students - by seeing the potential in\neach of them. Empowering students with the mathematical thinking and analytical\nskills will create stronger individuals who are ready for college, careers, and\ncommunity engagement. Even if students do not pursue a STEM career, they would\nbe able to use concepts to do data analysis, problem solving, and critical\nthinking in professional and personal environments.\n\nThere is skepticism about \u201cdetracking\u201d students and whether this will diminish\nstudents ability to excel in a diverse classroom. However, math can be\nmultidimensional and creative in its approach without diminishing rigor.\nTeachers have long differentiated instruction to meet student needs. If students\nare in a diverse classroom, they all benefit from the divergent thinking and\napproaches to math. They will be able to learn from one another and the multiple\nperspectives that are in the classroom. There are no limits in learning. Using\nthis framework, classrooms could also become more collaborative, inquiry based,\nand engaging. Students who are more engaged in classes are more likely to stay\non task and reach learning objectives.\n\nThis framework is a foundation for schools to launch academic programs and\ninstruction that will meet the current needs of our student population. It is an\ninvestment in our future that will support our state and nation because it\nempowers a new generation of learners, thinkers, and creators.\n",

    "Comments": "I am writing as a parent and stakeholder with two children in\nCalifornia\u2019s public school system. My children attend high school and middle\nschool in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in the city of Los\nAngeles, CA. They have attended CA public schools since they were in\nkindergarten. (Stakeholders are addressed in Ch. 1 of the California Math\nFramework.)\n\nOur family is in a unique position in that our children have tried out both\ntraditional math programs and models that align with the new California Math\nFramework in their respective schools. Having lived experience with the\nrecommendations put forth in the CMF, I am writing to urge the CA BOE to reject\nthe proposed California Math Framework in its current form.\n\nI have heard the phrase, \u201cyour children are not a data set,\u201d but they are the\ndata set I know the best. My kids took math at public schools that have adopted\nthe recommendations contained in the new CMF and math at public schools that did\nnot. Both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed CMF\nmodels of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs\nthat did not employ the CMF\u2019s recommendations.\n\nMy children\u2019s first elementary school was an independent charter named Larchmont\nCharter School in Los Angeles. Larchmont was an early adopter of the CMF\u2019s\nproposed models. Years before other public schools worked to align themselves\nwith the new CMF, faculty at Larchmont Charter School worked closely with UCLA\u2019s\nCenter X \u002f UCLA Mathematics Project to incorporate CGI Math into their\ncurriculum. Larchmont teachers followed Jo Boaler at Stanford and her work\nbuilding on Carol Dweck\u2019s \u201cgrowth mindsets,\u201d which guided them in creating model\nmath classrooms for their students. Larchmont was a high-performing school with\nengaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the PD.\n\nThe resulting math program, however, was not effective for my two kids, both of\nwhom work several years above grade level. My students bemoaned the coursework,\nwhich was remedial, repetitive, slow-paced, and featured a lot of writing about\ntheir thinking for very simple concepts. Once they moved over to LAUSD proper,\nwhich followed a more traditional math path, they both soared ahead and\ndiscovered they loved math. In fifth grade, my daughter remarked, \u201cI can\u2019t\nbelieve Larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm!\u201d\n\nUsing a standard algorithm (and just\u2026doing math problems) made everything click\ninto place for these particular kids. I was therefore dismayed to see the\ncurrent CMF recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until\nmuch later in elementary \u2013 using culminating standards as a guide of when to\nteach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the\nCommon Core (see elementary school guidance re: when multiplication, division,\netc. are taught, CMF page 83.)\n\nBut Larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models. Last year, in\nLAUSD, our child\u2019s former school, Gaspar de Portola Middle School implemented a\npilot program for the district that was aligned with the new CMF. Portola\nswitched from teaching the \u201cBig Ideas\u201d math curriculum to \u201cIllustrative Math\u201d in\n2022-2023. Teachers underwent extensive PD. Parent booster groups spent tens of\nthousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new\ncurriculum.\n\nAgain, the progressive math model (executed by excellent teachers and staff) was\na disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace. Gaspar de\nPortola Middle School houses a Highly Gifted Magnet (HGM) for kids who typically\nwork 3 years ahead of grade level. Parents at the HGM, (knowing nothing about\nthe Math Wars raging in Sacramento) were incredibly dismayed by the new\ncurriculum.\n\nOne parent, a STEM PhD and retired astrophysicist, patiently did every problem\nset in both the \u201cBig Ideas\u201d (traditional) textbook and the (new) \u201cIllustrative\nMath\u201d textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the\nnew progressive model. Dismayed by what he found, he wrote a letter to our\nprincipal, which I am excerpting here:\n\n\u201cAs for IM, first of all, I strongly applaud LAUSD and Portola's initiative and\neffort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state\nof math proficiency in the general student population in LAUSD and in the\ncountry. IM textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited\nto many, if not most student's needs and ability. IM tries to make students\nfully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by\nreorganizing math topics, offering a lot of repetitions, and showing various\nways to explain the same concepts. My son (*name withheld) I believe, is\nbenefitting from IM\u2019s methodology, repetitiveness, and slower pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, I have to say that IM does not serve HGM kids\u2019 needs well at all\n(especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond) and\nis a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability. Ultimately it does\nnot prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like Pre-Cal and\nCalculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and\napproach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like Big Idea Math.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere are some of the IM\u2019s shortcomings as a high-school level math textbook in\nthe context of HGM (especially Algebra 1&2, and Geometry):\u201d\n\n- \u201cIM covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower\nknowledge base due to its slower pace. It does not delve deep enough into\nmaterials, compared to Big Ideas Math and other common core math textbooks. It\noffers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts, which\nbores and even confuses students.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIM lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and\nseems to be a 'watered-down' version of traditional math textbooks.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIM\u2019s approach does not align with that of college textbooks.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIM doesn't offer enough texts, guidelines, and exercises after each\nlesson\u002fchapter for students to further their investigation and study after\nschool.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIM\u2019s lesson\u002fchapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard\nmathematical terms, equations, theorems, and conventions that are essential for\na smooth transition to future courses such as Calculus and Physics.\u201d \u2026\n\n- \u201cWe have math teachers at HGM who are highly skilled in using Big Idea Math.\nHaving them switch to a very different and possibly inferior way of teaching\nseems to be a huge waste of their talent and expertise.\u201d\n\n- \u201cBecause of the deficiency of the IM textbook and curriculum, some HGM parents\nare compelled to seek outside help and tutoring, which adds extra and\nunnecessary workload and burden to students and parents at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, I believe that whilst IM may be a suitable choice for the general\nstudent population, it is unfortunately an inadequate and unsuitable selection\nfor the HGM students.\u201d\n(End of excerpted letter)\n\nHere, the critique of Illustrative Math can be extrapolated and applied to the\ngeneral shape of the math curriculum put forth in the new CMF, as the underlying\nprinciples and techniques are similar to those outlined in the first several\nchapters of the CMF.\n\nIn two separate schools in two separate examples, our family discovered that new\nprogressive math curriculum aligned with the CMF was woefully inadequate when it\ncame to addressing the specific set of learning needs of high achievers. Nor did\nit adequately prepare students for college level math. The slow pace and the\nrepetition of the more progressive math models (which circle back again and\nagain) temporarily killed the fast learners\u2019 love of math.\n\nAt scale, the proposed CMF recommendations will potentially violate state law by\nmaking high achievers repeat classes and concepts they have already mastered.\nThose learners deserve to experience growth within their Zones of Proximal\nDevelopment. Further, despite the CMF throwing out decades of research re:\ngifted learners (by asserting that there is no such thing \u2013 it\u2019s all a growth\nmindset) these learners require appropriate placement as guaranteed by the Math\nPlacement Act to support their academic growth.\n\nAll this said, the population of learners who needs the most help with math in\nCA is not the group of outliers at the top. The CMF is rightly concerned with\nthe math achievement gap between various ethnic, racial, and cultural groups.\n\nHowever, this is also where the proposed CMF is at its most cynical. For a\ndocument that is primarily concerned with equity, the authors of the CMF do not\noffer solid data and peer-reviewed research to support their hypothesis that\ntheir drastic overhaul to math education in CA will actually make anything more\nequitable for those who need it most.\nIn previous drafts of the CMF, the authors cited San Francisco Unified School\nDistrict\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d with de-tracking Algebra in 2014 as proof that their\napproach to revamping K-12 math worked. When new information re: SFUSD\u2019s program\nsurfaced, the available data did not support that claim. In fact, it now appears\nthat SFUSD\u2019s de-tracking experiment was a disaster, further exacerbating the\nmath achievement gap for black and Latinx students. The only way students could\nprepare for the accelerated classes in high school was to take expensive\nsupplemental math outside of their public schools as a workaround.\nEconomically-disadvantaged kids continued to be the ones least likely to take\nthe private classes. (See: \u201cSFUSD's delay of algebra 1 has created a nightmare\nof workarounds\u201d by Rex Ridgeway, San Francisco Examiner, March 8, 2023)\nWhile SFUSD\u2019s failed math experiment has been removed from this draft of the\nCMF, the model that drove SFUSD\u2019s failure remains the proposed math model of\nchoice for the California Board of Education. Why? What data supports the\nauthors\u2019 hypothesis without hard facts to back it?\nThe CMF authors\u2019 biggest argument against traditional math is that it\nperpetuates inequity via tracking. Their solution is to remove accelerated\nclasses and de-track, but they wind up proposing a whole new track (data\nscience) that will heartlessly trap kids who were hoping to enter STEM majors in\ncollege into a new dead end.\nAs Brian Conrad of Stanford has explained at length, when students take data\nscience as an alternative to the pre-requisite they actually need, calculus, the\neffect will be to kill their STEM careers before they start. How is taking\naccelerated math in middle school a problem, but encouraging kids to pursue an\nentirely new data science track for the entirety of their high school career\nthat may or may not meet UC standards for advanced math \u2013 that may bar them from\nSTEM majors - not a dirty trick? Here, the BOE must consider the following\narticle just printed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, \u201cThe University of\nCalifornia Changed Its Math Standards. Some Faculty Aren\u2019t Happy\u201d by Stephanie\nM. Lee, 7\u002f6\u002f23. The article backs up Conrad\u2019s many critiques of Chapter 5 of the\nCMF. The inequity and issues that the data science track poses must be addressed\nbefore moving forward.\nThe problem with \u201ctracking,\u201d after all, is getting stuck on a track. However,\nwhen tracks are turned into pathways with many entryways, students can learn at\nan appropriate pace with a similar ability group (a much needed grouping in\nlarge public schools). They can even level-up to a new group without the\ncurriculum getting dumbed-down into a \u201cone sized fits all model.\u201d Why was this\nsolution not considered? Why is the de-tracking model used in SFUSD still in the\nCMF (without the accompanying data showing it didn\u2019t work) when math models like\nthose employed in the Long Beach Unified School District \u2013 where kids can be\ntaught on different pathways that they can leave and enter - have actually\nproven to deliver more equitable results?\n\nFinally, the authors of the CMF have targeted anyone raising questions about\ntheir data, methods, and models as politically-motivated. In Chapter 9, the\nauthors assert re: the Common Core adoption of 2001 that, \u201cThe most organized\nresistance came from politically-affiliated groups who resist equitable change\n(see for example, Evers, 2021). More recently, the changes proposed for the\nCalifornia Math Framework have been met with similar opposition.\u201d Like many big\nsweeping statements, this last assertion is not backed by a peer-reviewed study.\nIt does not take into account the letter to the BOE signed by over 1,1000 STEM\nprofessionals \u2013 or the valid critiques (still unaddressed) that came from the\nhead of undergraduate math at Stanford, Brian Conrad. It is instead a link to a\nYouCubed blog post.\n\nAnd here is the most pressing issue. The BOE must reject any references in this\ncurrent framework that do not hold up under scrutiny. There should be no\nnon-academic research included in the CMF. Non peer-reviewed papers have no\nstandards. They have no business being used as references for a math framework\ndesigned to change the schooling of millions of students. Blog posts and opinion\npieces must be removed for the CMF to have any credulity as an academic\ndocument. The many references to YouCubed and the CMF authors\u2019 commercial\nconcerns must be removed. (Given the sheer amount of new textbooks that will be\nrequired by the new CMF, it is a massive conflict of interest to make this\ndocument an infomercial for the YouCubed group.)\n\nThe new revised CMF still reads as an aspirational document. It is a massive\nhypothesis without the peer-reviewed data to back up its assertions. While it\nhas been clear for some time that the CMF math models do not work for the\nfastest learners, the CMF will more gravely change math for all children in the\nstate in the name of equity, with no proof that its methods and models are able\nto deliver equitable results for students who are at the most risk of being\nsidelined in math.\n\nAs a parent stakeholder whose family has been the test case for this big ideas\nand concepts aligned with this math model, I urge you to vote \u201cno\u201d on adopting\nthe revised CMF. Thank you.\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019ve worked with the Board and with CDE on numerous documents over recent\ndecades and have extensive experience with situations where policy decisions are\nfraught with politics, going back to the \u201cCalifornia Math Wars\u201d and the 1997\nMath Standards.\n\nThe Board has listened to the objections to the previous drafts and has made\nappropriate clarifications and explications, resulting in a better document, one\nthat makes progress in notable ways, especially in providing greater foundations\nfor success for the full diversity of California\u2019s population. The time has come\nto approve it, and to turn energies to its implementation, which in my opinion\nis where the greatest difference can be made. To vote this down could open the\ndoor for insurgent reactionary politics and endless policy fighting. Please\nadopt this mathematics framework.\n",

I\nurge you to adopt and support its implementation.\n\nAs mathematics lesson study participants, we have had the opportunity to apply\nmuch of the research-based pedagogy stated in the draft Mathematics Framework\nwhich has resulted in continuously seeing students change from non-participants\nin mathematics classes to becoming mathematics thinkers and doers. From this\nsample of CA classrooms and their existence proof, I am very much encouraged\nthat progress can be made. To implement this framework system wide will take\ntime, continuous professional learning, as well as ongoing communication with\nthe community.\n\nI appreciate the framework highlighting data science since it is integral to\nmaking sense of the jobs we do, citizenship responsibilities, medical decisions,\nclimate science, etc. It is essential for students to understand that data and\nstatistics impact every aspect of our lives. Understanding, critiquing, and\napplying data science is essential if we are going to make reasoned decisions\nabout improvements. I would hope that educators can use data science as we\ntransition to using the ideas embedded in this framework to analyze our progress\nand inquiries into implementation efforts understanding there will be strengths\nand weaknesses in our efforts.\n\nI am hopeful for teachers and students in our state that we will have the\nopportunity to leverage this framework to craft meaningful mathematics learning\nfor our students and ourselves. The CA Board of Education and writing teams\nshould be commended for articulating this complex vision of mathematics\ninstruction and their investment in improving learning opportunities for each\nand every California student.\n",

    "Comments": "I strongly oppose to the proposed California Math Framework. I have\nbeen teaching math in California for 41 years and have a degree in mathematics.\n\nI have carefully studied the proposed framework. It steers teachers away from\nusing clear direct instruction and from requiring their students to master math\nfacts and algorithms at the right stages of their mathematical development. For\nexample, students who do not memorize their times tables by the end of 3rd grade\ntypically struggle when they try to learn fractions in 4th grade, or decimals in\n5th grade, etc. The Framework is opposed to the Common Core Standards on this\npoint -- yet the Framework is intended to help teachers implement the Common\nCore Standards.\n\nThe proposed framework will be particularly harmful to students whose families\ndo not have the resources to pay for private math tutors or after-school classes\nto supplement their math education. Affluent families will be better positioned\nto seek outside help for their children to succeed in middle and high school\nmath and prepare for STEM careers. This will widen the existing achievement gap\neven further.\n\nThere is no legitimate research to back up the claims of the Framework which in\nmany cases defy common sense. Instead, the claims are supported by blog posts by\none of the authors or by small scale studies with falsified data (none of it\npeer-reviewed). It has been clearly established that the claimed success of San\nFrancisco's de-tracking experiment was actually based on false claims (or math\nerrors).\n\nPlease reject this proposed Mathematics Framework. California's children deserve\nmuch better. ",

    "Comments": "The revised 2023 Framework is an excellent step in the right\ndirection and will help secure a strong foundation for students in mathematics.\nThe foundation is critical in giving all students an opportunity for success\nwhere as past Frameworks have isolated students and divided them in a top down\napproach. The revised Framework gives a much clearer direction for districts to\nfollow as well as curriculum developers that have continued to use past\nstandards in their pedagogy in order to market their product. The new Framework\nwill hold teachers more accountable and enforce a needed change in instructional\npractices in order to compete with other countries that continue to surpass our\nstudents in achievement. Common Core was never really implemented and the new\nFramework will stabilize the message that we are moving forward and not\nbackward. It's time we all get on the same page and stop looking at the past as\nwe already know where that will lead. ",

    "Comments": "REJECT CMF 3.0. Heterogeneously leveled classes are a disaster,\nspeaking from experience. The CMF places all students from a particular grade in\nthe same class, thus superficially eliminating the appearance of disparities. My\nchild has lived through these delaned classes in middle school. This one size\nfits all classroom, with complex problems that have minimal reinforcement of\neach student\u2019s individual instructional needs, and it does not serve any of the\nstudents. Complex word problems are hard for non-native speakers to understand\nand find math concepts. Struggling students don\u2019t get the extra practice and\nclose attention they need because only a fraction of the problem is relevant to\nthem. Students who have mastered the material are frustrated because they cannot\nprogress to their full potential. The excuse I was repeatedly given for making\nmy child repeat material she has already mastered in these classrooms is that\nshe would have \u201cdeeper\u201d learning but I have spent many years looking in the\nscientific literature and have found NO operational definition of the concept or\ndemonstration that heterogeneous classes geared at lower level instruction help\nstudents. Instead, parents of these advanced students who have means pay for\nexternal classes and tutors during middle school to overcome this problem.\n\nIn high school, those without financial means that have not had this enrichment\nand can\u2019t compete and likely receive lower grades and grades determine whether\nthey have a chance at these highly competitive engineering programs. The Palo\nAlto district they tried to enforce this delaning in high school. To accomplish\nthis they violated the California Math Placement Act by forcing most students\ninto the same Geometry class as high school freshmen (they made it a graduation\nrequirement) regardless of whether they already took the class. They refused to\nperform testing to evaluate whether this class would benefit the student (this\nwas the legal violation). Struggling students complained about having stronger\nstudents in their class because this caused them stress and was unfair\ncompetition. Encouraging economically disadvantaged students that receive lower\ngrades to take \u201cdata science\u201d instead of calculus sabotages their chances of a\nSTEM college degree. The San Francisco public school model of delaying Algebra 1\nuntil high school made reaching calculus impossible without paying for external\nclasses, thus destroying any chance at equity for economically disadvantaged\nstudents. Blocking access to calculus makes being accepted to college\nengineering virtually impossible. Even if these students were allowed into these\nprograms, covering advanced math in high school saves STEM-aspiring,\neconomically disadvantaged students college tuition for those same courses. And\nstill worse, entering a STEM college program without adequate preparation makes\ndisadvantaged students vulnerable to being \u201cweeded out\u201d and left with high\ntuition debts. ",

    "Comments": "Public Comment #2 on TFR:\nKathryn Jordan\nkjordan114wh@gmail.com\n\nShould injecting ideology take precedence over academic outcomes in the\nCalifornia Math Framework (CMF)?\n\nPlease reject the CMF Third Field Review (TFR) and retain the 2013 CMF.\n\nThe CMF\u2019s Third Field Review begins by discussing CA students\u2019 poor math\nproficiency, and then claims that this poor performance demands implementation\nof its ideological and pedagogical proposals, ignoring that its proposals may\nactually make student proficiency worse.\n\nThe same TFR proposals made student proficiency worse at SFUSD, where detracking\nand equity focused proposals have been implemented since 2014. SFUSD\u2019s math\nprogram, the TFR\u2019s mirror image, has led to decreased student math proficiency\nand increased inequity. (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19; see SFUSD\nat The Research Doesn\u2019t\nAdd Up at savemath.net\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fsavemath.net__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YOmEJUwUvcqnNtVJ6Sup8pppR5AKIhu1YmmwTeeUdnTgvQxhtvrQEQ3edD0091YZmF0LIOGFXJoV_OTm3gg9B2Wb$],\nsee FFSF Inequity in Numbers report, see \u2018Put Algebra 1 back in 8th Grade\u2019,\nRidgeway, Margulies)\n\nNow that the failure of SFUSD\u2019s math program is known, it isn\u2019t mentioned in the\nTFR, though SFUSD did figure prominently in the CMF\u2019s First Field Review (FFR).\nBy avoiding mention of SFUSD, the TFR avoids drawing attention to the failure of\nits own proposals. This tactic isn\u2019t surprising, as the TFR continues to propose\nimplementing these same failed proposals for all of CA\u2019s almost 6 million public\nschool children.\n\nEven the evidence the TFR does put forward to support its signature detracking\nproposal, from which so many of its other proposals stem, is compromised. The\nkey supporting study in the TFR, known as \u2018The Railside Study,\u2019 has been heavily\ncritiqued and some would say, discredited. Further, its lead author, a writer of\nthe CMF, hasn\u2019t responded to requests to share data, to permit independent\nverification of its results.\n\nAnother key detracking paper cited in the TFR, \u2018Raising Expectations...\u2019 2021,\nis an unpublished, non peer reviewed, scantily detailed paper, which one\ncommentator called \u2018a blog post\u2019 (see @mikeandallie tweets).\n\nThe one study the TFR cites that shows detracking student benefit, is\nmisrepresented, by shading discussion of the study\u2019s findings to emphasize just\nthe detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention, presumably because it\nis a study of 8th grade Algebra acceleration for all, which the TFR discourages.\n\n\u2018The Railside Study\u2019 and the \u2018Raising Expectations...\u201d papers claim that\ndetracking leads to student academic benefit, but neither can reliably support\nthat conclusion. SFUSD\u2019s results certainly do not support it.\n\nDetracking is the core TFR go-to proposal, from which other proposals stem, such\nas heterogeneous (differing student math level) classrooms (through 10th grade),\nthe use of \u2018big ideas\u2019 and \u2018rich\u2019 \u2018open\u2019 math tasks to permit multiple entry\nlevel points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels, and\nthe use of \u2018Complex Instruction\u2019, to manage interactions in the heterogeneous\nclassroom. None of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student\nacademic outcomes. In any case, SFUSD has already implemented all of these\nproposals as a package, and the result was decreased student math proficiency\n(See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19), and increased inequity (see \u2018Put\nAlgebra 1 back in 8th grade\u2019, Ridgeway, Margulies).\n\nTFR suggests implementing the same proposals statewide.\n\nIs it because the TFR\u2019s ideological commitment to detracking, 'equity',\n'equitable outcomes' takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes?\nAt times, the TFR reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum\nframework.\n\nFor example, the TFR says the CMF\u2019s goal is \u2018equity\u2019 (Ch. 1). The TFR\u2019s Glossary\ndefines \u2018equity\u2019 as \u2018fairness, not sameness\u2019, but \u2018fairness\u2019 and \u2018sameness\u2019\naren\u2019t similarly defined. The \u2018equity\u2019 definition points to a paper, Gutierrez\n(2012) (\u201cContext Matters\u2026\u201d), and a rubric within the paper, to explain how\nachieving equity in math education will occur. The 4 dimension rubric, however,\nis based on Marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics (see\npage 20 in \u201cContext Matters\u2026\u201d Gutierrez 2012).\n\nThe TFR text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from Critical Race\nTheory, like \u2018equity\u2019, \u2018equitable outcomes,\u2019 \u2018systemic change,\u2019 \u2018systemic\nissues, \u2018examine inequities,\u2019\u2018structural barriers,\u2019 \u2018structural injustices\u2019,\n\u2018institutional injustices\u2019, \u2018challenge the status quo\u2019, \u2018social order\u2019, \u2018culture\nof exclusion\u2019, \u2018inequitable\u2019, \u2018inequities,\u2019 \u2018challenge inequities,\u2019 \u2018structural\ninequities,\u2019 \u2018systemic inequities,\u2019 \u2018historically marginalized\u2019, and\n\u2018historically underrepresented,\u2019 all of which are part of the CRT lexicon, and\nstem from its core tenet of \u2018systemic racism\u2019. CRT\u2019s contested ideology, derived\nfrom Marxism, can be described as\n\n\u201cIt (CRT) is a Marxian faith system based on the belief that society is\norganized by white people for their own benefit through something Critical Race\ntheorists call \u2018systemic racism.\u2019\u201d (James Lindsay, \u2018What is Critical Race\nTheory\u2019 Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 1, (8:22 and onward) -\nhttps:newdiscourses.com)\n\n\u2018Awakening a \u201ctrue\u201d racial consciousness that is aware of this (systemic racism)\nand that unequivocally rejects it (and whiteness itself as its root) is\ntherefore the chief program of Critical Race Theory.\u2019 (James Lindsay, \u2018Race\nMarxism\u2019, New Discourses, pg. 13)\n\nWhile Critical Race Theory aims to raise a \u2018racial consciousness\u2019; the TFR\npromoted pedagogy, Culturally Relevant Teaching, aims to raise a \u2018critical\nconsciousness\u2019.\n\nAccording to the Calif Dept. of Education (CDE)\n(https:\u002f\u002fwww.cde.ca.gov\u002fpd\u002fee\u002fculturalrelevantpedagogy.asp), Culturally Relevant\nTeaching consists of three components, all of which \u2018must be utilized\u2019,\nincluding supporting a students\u2019 \u2018critical consciousness,\u2019 which is the ability\nto recognize and critique societal inequalities. The term, \u2018Critical\nconsciousness\u2019, comes from the Brazilian Marxist Paulo Freire, and is designed\nto create Marxist political activists by engaging in Marxist thought reform (See\n\u2018The Marxification of Education\u2019).\n\nSocial and Emotional Learning (SEL) also makes an appearance in the CMF TFR (Ch.\n13). Strands of SEL, such as Transformational SEL, and others, also derive from\nMarxism, according to New Discourses.\n\nThe TFR also includes elements from Gender Ideology, and a section on \u2018Teaching\ntowards Social Justice\u2019; suggesting both should be incorporated into math\ncurriculum and instruction.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the prevalence of these ideologies in a proposed math curriculum\nthat\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s that the TFR favors ideological proposals known to lead\nto academic failure. And it\u2019s also that these ideologies, if implemented in\npublic school, would contravene a number of state and federal laws and\nConstitutional provisions.\n\nThe purpose of a state curriculum framework is to implement state standards, not\nto inject woke ideologies. Reject the TFR; retain the 2013 CMF.\n",

I wish I could say I\nread everything completely but with the limited time you allowed to review and\nover a holiday weekend, I was not able to accomplish that task as I will assumed\nyour release planned to accomplish minimum responses. From what I read, I'm\nimpressed. You took a basic subject such as math and politicized it with\nsolutions that will not only lower mathematical competency but put a larger\nburden on the system especially those with task of teaching this subject.\n\nI would suggest you look at areas where students thrive in Math and attempt to\nemulate them. Countries such as China and Philippines have excelled in this\nsubject as have the states of Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho.\n\nAs a California student I was fortunate to be able to perform math functions\nacceptability. My skill set wasn't the result of me being included or coming\nfrom a higher economical background. I was good because I was taught the basic\nand had to repetitively solve different problems that where presented to me.\nLike anything, the more I did it the problems, the better myself and the\nclassmates who kept up did. It was a simple concept that will still work today.\n\nI don't know how California lost it's way in basic teaching curriculum.\nI guess the worry now must be pornographic books not being as your offices says\n\u201cbanned\u201d from library. That would be threatening to certain students.\n\nI don't know what math skills are going to be gained from teaching equity. Maybe\nyou will have to emphasize division in order to teach equality. Two subjects\nthat separate and devoid from each other.\n\nJust like in a casino, I will have to wish the students of California a hardy\n\u201cGood Luck\u201d with this framework. The odds, just like in a casino are going to be\nagainst them. The students will need luck in order to learn math skills with\nthis plan.",

    "Comments": "Public Comment #2 on TFR:\nKathryn Jordan\nkjordan114wh@gmail.com\n\nShould injecting ideology take precedence over academic outcomes in the\nCalifornia Math Framework (CMF)?\n\nPlease reject the CMF Third Field Review (TFR) and retain the 2013 CMF.\n\nThe CMF\u2019s Third Field Review begins by discussing CA students\u2019 poor math\nproficiency, and then claims that this poor performance demands implementation\nof its ideological and pedagogical proposals, ignoring that its proposals may\nactually make student proficiency worse.\n\nThe same TFR proposals made student proficiency worse at SFUSD, where detracking\nand equity focused proposals have been implemented since 2014. SFUSD\u2019s math\nprogram, the TFR\u2019s mirror image, has led to decreased student math proficiency\nand increased inequity. (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19; see SFUSD\nat The Research Doesn\u2019t\nAdd Up at savemath.net\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fsavemath.net__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YgX0m9QAluWGh4kX7iGQ1BotEgGwwS03-DBoY1gF2VLWJCFAPFGAN_JPTRGkWMPzKnQ4bKe-rmY58ElnmrGv8v4z$],\nsee FFSF Inequity in Numbers report, see \u2018Put Algebra 1 back in 8th Grade\u2019,\nRidgeway, Margulies)\n\nNow that the failure of SFUSD\u2019s math program is known, it isn\u2019t mentioned in the\nTFR, though SFUSD did figure prominently in the CMF\u2019s First Field Review (FFR).\nBy avoiding mention of SFUSD, the TFR avoids drawing attention to the failure of\nits own proposals. This tactic isn\u2019t surprising, as the TFR continues to propose\nimplementing these same failed proposals for all of CA\u2019s almost 6 million public\nschool children.\n\nEven the evidence the TFR does put forward to support its signature detracking\nproposal, from which so many of its other proposals stem, is compromised. The\nkey supporting study in the TFR, known as \u2018The Railside Study,\u2019 has been heavily\ncritiqued and some would say, discredited. Further, its lead author, a writer of\nthe CMF, hasn\u2019t responded to requests to share data, to permit independent\nverification of its results.\n\nAnother key detracking paper cited in the TFR, \u2018Raising Expectations...\u2019 2021,\nis an unpublished, non peer reviewed, scantily detailed paper, which one\ncommentator called \u2018a blog post\u2019 (see @mikeandallie tweets).\n\nThe one study the TFR cites that shows detracking student benefit, is\nmisrepresented, by shading discussion of the study\u2019s findings to emphasize just\nthe detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention, presumably because it\nis a study of 8th grade Algebra acceleration for all, which the TFR discourages.\n\n\u2018The Railside Study\u2019 and the \u2018Raising Expectations...\u201d papers claim that\ndetracking leads to student academic benefit, but neither can reliably support\nthat conclusion. SFUSD\u2019s results certainly do not support it.\n\nDetracking is the core TFR go-to proposal, from which other proposals stem, such\nas heterogeneous (differing student math level) classrooms (through 10th grade),\nthe use of \u2018big ideas\u2019 and \u2018rich\u2019 \u2018open\u2019 math tasks to permit multiple entry\nlevel points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels, and\nthe use of \u2018Complex Instruction\u2019, to manage interactions in the heterogeneous\nclassroom. None of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student\nacademic outcomes. In any case, SFUSD has already implemented all of these\nproposals as a package, and the result was decreased student math proficiency\n(See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19), and increased inequity (see \u2018Put\nAlgebra 1 back in 8th grade\u2019, Ridgeway, Margulies).\n\nTFR suggests implementing the same proposals statewide.\n\nIs it because the TFR\u2019s ideological commitment to detracking, 'equity',\n'equitable outcomes' takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes?\nAt times, the TFR reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum\nframework.\n\nFor example, the TFR says the CMF\u2019s goal is \u2018equity\u2019 (Ch. 1). The TFR\u2019s Glossary\ndefines \u2018equity\u2019 as \u2018fairness, not sameness\u2019, but \u2018fairness\u2019 and \u2018sameness\u2019\naren\u2019t similarly defined. The \u2018equity\u2019 definition points to a paper, Gutierrez\n(2012) (\u201cContext Matters\u2026\u201d), and a rubric within the paper, to explain how\nachieving equity in math education will occur. The 4 dimension rubric, however,\nis based on Marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics (see\npage 20 in \u201cContext Matters\u2026\u201d Gutierrez 2012).\n\nThe TFR text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from Critical Race\nTheory, like \u2018equity\u2019, \u2018equitable outcomes,\u2019 \u2018systemic change,\u2019 \u2018systemic\nissues, \u2018examine inequities,\u2019\u2018structural barriers,\u2019 \u2018structural injustices\u2019,\n\u2018institutional injustices\u2019, \u2018challenge the status quo\u2019, \u2018social order\u2019, \u2018culture\nof exclusion\u2019, \u2018inequitable\u2019, \u2018inequities,\u2019 \u2018challenge inequities,\u2019 \u2018structural\ninequities,\u2019 \u2018systemic inequities,\u2019 \u2018historically marginalized\u2019, and\n\u2018historically underrepresented,\u2019 all of which are part of the CRT lexicon, and\nstem from its core tenet of \u2018systemic racism\u2019. CRT\u2019s contested ideology, derived\nfrom Marxism, can be described as\n\n\u201cIt (CRT) is a Marxian faith system based on the belief that society is\norganized by white people for their own benefit through something Critical Race\ntheorists call \u2018systemic racism.\u2019\u201d (James Lindsay, \u2018What is Critical Race\nTheory\u2019 Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 1, (8:22 and onward) -\nhttps:newdiscourses.com)\n\n\u2018Awakening a \u201ctrue\u201d racial consciousness that is aware of this (systemic racism)\nand that unequivocally rejects it (and whiteness itself as its root) is\ntherefore the chief program of Critical Race Theory.\u2019 (James Lindsay, \u2018Race\nMarxism\u2019, New Discourses, pg. 13)\nWhile Critical Race Theory aims to raise a \u2018racial consciousness\u2019; the TFR\npromoted pedagogy, Culturally Relevant Teaching, aims to raise a \u2018critical\nconsciousness\u2019.\n\nAccording to the Calif Dept. of Education (CDE)\n(https:\u002f\u002fwww.cde.ca.gov\u002fpd\u002fee\u002fculturalrelevantpedagogy.asp), Culturally Relevant\nTeaching consists of three components, all of which \u2018must be utilized\u2019,\nincluding supporting a students\u2019 \u2018critical consciousness,\u2019 which is the ability\nto recognize and critique societal inequalities. The term, \u2018Critical\nconsciousness\u2019, comes from the Brazilian Marxist Paulo Freire, and is designed\nto create Marxist political activists by engaging in Marxist thought reform (See\n\u2018The Marxification of Education\u2019).\n\nSocial and Emotional Learning (SEL) also makes an appearance in the CMF TFR (Ch.\n13). Strands of SEL, such as Transformational SEL, and others, also derive from\nMarxism, according to New Discourses.\n\nThe TFR also includes elements from Gender Ideology, and a section on \u2018Teaching\ntowards Social Justice\u2019; suggesting both should be incorporated into math\ncurriculum and instruction.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the prevalence of these ideologies in a proposed math curriculum\nthat\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s that the TFR favors ideological proposals known to lead\nto academic failure. And it\u2019s also that these ideologies, if implemented in\npublic school, would contravene a number of state and federal laws and\nConstitutional provisions (see Kathryn Jordan public comment on the TFR).\n\nThe purpose of a state curriculum framework is to implement state standards, not\nto inject woke ideologies. Reject the TFR; retain the 2013 CMF.\n",

    "Comments": "The CMF is repeating the failed removal of Phonics Experiment but\nnow with math. Neuroscience showed us that learning phonics is vital and should\nnot be subjugated to social emotional learning. The ultimate irony was a\nreference in CMF to an fMRI study that compared 15 students with and 15 students\nwithout math learning disability that used the CMF 2013 techniques and showed\nbrain activity normalized in students with math learning disabilities. Here is\nthe quote.\n\u201cOne study conducted by neuroscientists in Stanford\u2019s School of Medicine\nexamined the effects of a tutoring intervention with students who had been\ndiagnosed as having mathematics \u201clearning disabilities\u201d and those with no\nidentified difficulties in mathematics (Luculano et al., 2015). Prior to the\nintervention, the group of students with identified \u201clearning disabilities\u201d had\nlower mathematics performance and different brain activation patterns than\nstudents who had no identified difficulties in mathematics. After eight weeks of\none-on-one tutoring focused on strengthening student understanding of\nrelationships between and within operations, not only did both sets of students\ndemonstrate comparable achievement, but they also activated the same brain areas\n(Luculano et al., 2015). Since the brain is always developing in relation to the\nexperiences people are engaged in, well-designed and focused math experiences\nsupport the development of pathways in the brain that enable all students to\naccess and engage productively in the content.\u201d\nThe tutoring program in this study was described in the appendix of the paper\nand it extensive and followed the 2013 Framework guidance. The conclusion of the\nauthors was wrong. The authors demonstrated that the two groups differed LESS\nafter the training and there was no evidence of any development of new brain\n\u201cpathways\u201d in the students with learning disabilities. Furthermore, to claim\nanything about \u201call students\u201d on the basis of a tiny group of 15 students with\nlearning disabilities (it is unclear why the term is in quotes, almost as if\nauthors questioned the diagnosis) speaks to the difficulty these writers have in\ninterpreting brain science.

    "Comments": "RE: Letter of Support for the 2023 Mathematics Framework\n\nDear President Darling-Hammond and Members of the State Board of Education:\n\nI, Ma Bernadette Andres-Salgarino, am writing to express my wholehearted support\nfor the revised Mathematics Framework. As the President-Elect of the CA\nMathematics Council, Board Member of TODOS Mathematics for All, and a member of\nMath CFCC, I am committed to advocating for a high-quality mathematics education\nthat propels the success of ALL students in college, career, and life.\n\nThe revised Mathematics Framework is a significant step in addressing the urgent\nneed to improve mathematics teaching and learning. It strongly emphasizes equity\nand excellence, recognizing and celebrating students' diverse backgrounds,\ngenders, races, cultures, religions, and achievements. Furthermore, it outlines\nclear strategies to ensure that every student receives the necessary support and\nchallenges to thrive in their chosen pathways to success.\n\nA key strength of the revised Mathematics Framework is its student-centered\napproach. It provides comprehensive guidance to educators in establishing a\nsystem of support that aligns with rigorous, focused, and coherent standards, as\nexemplified through the Big Ideas. By centering on students, the framework\nfosters engagement and ownership of learning, empowering students to become\nactive participants in their mathematical journey.\n\nI am particularly enthusiastic about the framework\u2019s emphasis on expanding\naccess to joyful and relevant mathematics through Data Science for TK - 12. By\nequipping students with the knowledge, understanding, and skills to use data as\na tool for mathematical reasoning and problem-solving, the revised Mathematics\nFramework ensures that students are prepared to navigate the increasingly\ndata-driven world. This focus on Data Science will enhance students\u2019 critical\nthinking and analytical abilities, enabling them to make informed decisions and\ncontributions to society.\n\nEqually important is the framework\u2019s dedication to inclusivity and belonging. It\nprovides strategies to support diverse learners, including Multilingual\nLearners, students with disabilities, and students from historically\nmarginalized communities. This commitment to inclusivity ensures that all\nstudents have equitable access to high-quality mathematics education, fostering\na sense of belonging and creating opportunities for success.\n\nAs a parent and an experienced educator, I implore the State Board of Education\nto adopt the 2023 Mathematics Framework. This framework empowers students and\ntheir families, maximizing opportunities for growth and development. California\ncannot afford to wait any longer; we must take bold action to propel our\nchildren forward and enable them to thrive. For these compelling reasons, I\nwholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework.\n\nThank you for your attention on this critical matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMa Bernadette Andres-Salgarino\nPresident-Elect, California Mathematics Council\n",

    "Comments": "Ch 12 p4L74\u201d When anxious, the working memory\u2014the part of the brain\nneeded for reproducing mathematics facts\u2014is compromised.\u201d\nWRONG! Overlearning facts and testing KNOWLEDGE helps! Whereas the 2013\nFramework advocated for a MIX of rote learning to support development of fluency\nand problem-solving in instruction, in this revised Framework there is much\ndiscussion about how rote learning is a problem and that assessment and math\neducation must instead focus on testing complex reasoning problems to avoid\ndisadvantaging people with math anxiety. In fact, this is the opposite of what\nis best for students with high math anxiety. This was demonstrated long ago as\nthe anxiety-to-complexity effect (Faust, Ashcroft, and Fleck, 1996) \u201cThe more\ndifficult or complex the arithmetic problem, the more disadvantaged high maths\nanxious subjects are, in terms of either speed of processing or accuracy\u201d. Yes,\nworking memory that supports mental flexibility needed for reasoning problems is\nvulnerable to distraction and anxiety, but retrieval of facts depends on a\ndifferent mental process, semantic or declarative memory, not working memory.\nReproducing mathematics facts, if heavily overlearned, will likely make student\nperformance MORE resilient against math anxiety during testing. Having a strong\n\u201cconceptual\u201d representation depends on learning which involves both rehearsal of\narbitrary facts as well as learning conceptual relationships. But to dismiss as\nunimportant an entire approach to learning, notably practice, is as unwise as\ncutting out part of our brains. Chunking is an example of how our limited\ncapacity, working memory system, benefits from facts. Working memory capacity is\ntypically limited to 5 elements + or \u2013 2. Imagine holding in mind a short series\nof letters one has just heard (a g r z), or repeating those letters in reverse\nalphabetical order (z r g a). That is working memory. One can vastly expand\nworking memory capacity for holding in mind letters with arbitrary facts of how\nto spell words linked to knowledge (e.g. if one groups letters into the words\napple green red zero-17 letters held in mind!). The same principles are used in\nother fields. Musicians learn scales and arpeggios they practice to automaticity\nand these patterns enable them to play more fluently. Baseball pitchers and\nother ball-sports learn procedures to throw balls a high speeds. Riding a\nbicycle involves procedural fluency in the mechanics of the device to enable\nnavigation to new places. Similarly, math relies on multiple mental processes\nthat require fluency. If one has to figure out why 2+2=4 then then this process\nwill compete for this limited capacity of working memory. Lack of practice to\nautomaticity for students with math anxiety may indeed lead to those students\nhaving trouble retrieving facts but this would instead be due to inadequate\ninstruction. And this situation is what the Framework is advocating. ",

    "Comments": "Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond and the members of the California State\nBoard of Education,\n\nCalifornia needs to do more to meet the mathematics learning needs of ALL\nstudents. This draft Mathematics Framework, when implemented with integrity,\nwill challenge all of us, as it should, to stretch and grow and learn for the\nbenefit of our students and their futures. This Framework communicates we are\npaying attention to the data and listening to the voices of all students,\nincluding our most vulnerable.\n\nAs a grandparent, retired high school math teacher (from AP Calculus through\nalternative education), coach for new math teachers and member of the 2013 CA\nMath Framework Committee, I support the 2023 Revised Draft Mathematics Framework\nas recommended by the California Department of Education. I urge you to adopt\nthis Framework as presented.\n\nI shared my vision for mathematics learning at one of the 2019 Focus Group\nmeetings. I was not alone. The SBE listened to suggestions from myself and\nothers and approved guidelines that address the needs of all students and\nclarifies and builds upon the previous Framework. Through both public reviews, I\ncontinued to share my thoughts, concerns and appreciation as an individual and\nas a member of caring math educator communities. I signed the California Math\nCouncil\u2019s letter of support along with hundreds (2800+) of others.\n\nSome highlights of this Framework for me, to name a few of many:\n\u2022 Support for all learners\n\u2022 Guiding principles toward equity in mathematics instruction (Ch. 1, p. 11)\n\u2022 Five components of instructional design (Ch. 2, pp. 10- )\n\u2022 Assets-based approach to instruction (Ch. 2, p. 8)\n\u2022 Support for meaningful mathematics, including cultural and personal relevance\n(Ch. 2, p. 11)\n\u2022 Emphasis on Big Ideas and coherence across grades (Ch. 1, pp. 15-18, Ch. 2, p.\n13)\n\u2022 Designing instruction with integration in mind (Ch. 8, p. 25, 54)\n\u2022 Rigorous pathways in addition to the common pre-calculus\u002fcalculus pathway with\nmore choices for third- and fourth-year courses. (Ch. 8, pp. 29-31)\n\u2022 Elevate real-world application of mathematics understanding (Ch. 8, p. 32)\n\u2022 Reasoning with data (Ch. 1, p. 24)\n\nThe challenge to create an advisory, guiding document that is exactly what all\nstakeholders desire is an impossible task. This is an excellent document. All of\nthe persons involved in this monumental task of creating this forward-thinking\ndocument should be commended for their diligence in following the guidelines\napproved by the State Board in 2019 and be thanked for their huge investment of\ntime for the benefit of all students.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nBruce Grip\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Tom Loveless, the accomplished education researcher policy author of 16\nvolumes of the Brown Center Report on American Education, summarized the main\nconcerns about the framework's severe lack of quality research in his writing\nhere:\nhttps:\u002f\u002ffordhaminstitute.org\u002fnational\u002fcommentary\u002fevidence-struggling-math-students-and-californias-2022-math-framework\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__https:\u002f\u002ffordhaminstitute.org\u002fnational\u002fcommentary\u002fevidence-struggling-math-students-and-californias-2022-math-framework__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5zeU3nGcw$]\n\nThe part that stood out to me the most was: 'The 2022 California Math Framework\ndoes not reflect current scholarship on how to serve students who struggle when\nlearning mathematics. A search of studies cited in a recent What Works\nClearinghouse publication, \u201cAssisting Students Struggling with Mathematics:\nIntervention in the Elementary Grades,\u201d reveals absolutely no overlap. ... the\nprocess employed to search literature and select evidence for the framework\u2019s\nrecommendations is unknown.'\n\n2. In January 2022, one of the framework's co-authors, Katy Early, gave a\npresentation titled 'Teaching to Big Ideas' to our district's elementary staff.\nOne concern was that she distributed an article, which as a district we took\ntime to discuss, that denigrated timed math fluency practice. However, timed\nmath fluency practice has strong evidence, according to the federal What Works\nClearinghouses's practice guide on assisting struggling math students\n(https:\u002f\u002fies.ed.gov\u002fncee\u002fwwc\u002fPracticeGuide\u002f26\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__https:\u002f\u002fies.ed.gov\u002fncee\u002fwwc\u002fPracticeGuide\u002f26__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5yMwYAdtg$]).\nThe article she distributed mentioned anxiety related to timed math fluency\npractice, but the truth is 'No studies have determined that timed tests cause\nmath anxiety - defined as feelings of apprehension, tension, or fear that may\ninterfere with performance on math-related tasks.(a) In fact, timed tactics\nimprove math performance.(b),' according to the experts at Science of Math group\n(www.scienceofmath.com\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fwww.scienceofmath.com__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5wOycekEw$]).\nI asked Katy about the research behind the framework and her answer wasn't much\nbeyond 'it's got research behind it.' The result was some of our staff were\nconvinced we should not have math fact expectations or timed fluency practice\nanymore. This is sad and frustrating and bad for our kids. The framework wields\nimmediate influence to the detriment of our students.\n\n3. My final reason is presented as a set of questions for decision-makers such\nas yourself, and these come from Amanda VanDerHeyden, who is part of the Science\nof Math group:\n\nWhat do university mathematics professors think of the revised framework (not\nmath ed professors, but mathematics and more broadly, STEM professors)?\n\nWhat evidence do you have from well-controlled experimental studies that these\nrevisions will produce benefits to students? Where are the field trials that\nhave been through peer-review and show benefit? What are the measured costs or\nside-effects?\n\nWhat are the effects on learning for students from various backgrounds and\nstarting skill levels?\n\nWhat are the operationalized training models that will equip teachers to deliver\nthe new framework with sufficient integrity? What evidence can you show from\nrigorous research studies demonstrating that your manualized training systems\nwill equip teachers to implement?\n\nWho advised changing both the instructional scheme (your independent variable)\nand your measurement scheme (your dependent variables and measures) at the same\ntime? This is basic science 101 and doing this means that CA students' rights\nare not being protected.\n\nWhat is the alignment of the instruction (targets, methods) and assessments\nproposed in the new framework with the last 30 years of policy guidance and\nfunded federal research (e.g., the IES practice guides in mathematics that\nsummarize research evidence, national panels)?\n\nWhere are the voices & citations of the well-regarded substantive researchers in\nmathematical learning from all branches of psychology, from mathematics, from\nspecial education?\n\nThank you for your time in reading this.

Instead we are drenched\nwith inclusive language that, while may feel like a fair and respectful way to\neducate, does not apply to math nor serves our student body.\n\nDo not approve this. I repeat do not approve this. Our state has woefully low\nmaths comprehension and we owe it to our students to provide a foundation of\ntrue understanding in this subject. It\u2019s embarrassing that this document was\nproduced by a group tasked with improving the educational frameworks of our\nstate. I repeat, DO NOT APPROVE. ",

    "Comments": "As the president of the Orange County Mathematics Council and a\nSTEM coordinator for 23 CA elementary schools, I am writing to you to share my\nsupport for the adoption of the 2023 CA math framework. The focus on equity and\nanti-tracking is of particular importance. In fact, every professional\ndevelopment conference I have been to in the last few years, whether locally, or\nat the state or even national level, has focused on the issue of equity in math\neducation. Not only do many of our CA students need equitable math instruction\nand opportunities to succeed, but they deserve it. As educators, we must meet\nthe needs of our changing population, of every single one of our students, and\nthis framework sets teachers up to do exactly that.\n\nIn addition, I had the honor of being a part of the framework committee for the\nstate. As those who were in the room for the discussions know, the educators\ninvolved in this process were knowledgeable, highly respected in the field of\nmath education, and advocates for students of all races achieving at every\nlevel. The process was sound and the words in the framework agreed upon. We have\nknown without a doubt that this framework would improve student experiences,\nincrease learning, and set students up for a successful future as critical\nthinkers.\n\nPlease, with all of our CA students in mind, approve the math framework for our\nstate. If we want more of our children to succeed, this is the guiding document\nthat can allow that achievement to happen. Thank you. ",

    "Comments": "I am writing to support the inclusion of Chapter 5: Mathematical\nFoundations for Data Science.\n\nA growing evidence base suggests significant value for K-12 data science\nprograms and their positive impact on students trajectories. While these\nprograms may appear new, they build upon a strong foundation of education\nresearch and learning science literature stretching back over a decade.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2018, National Science Foundation grants supported the\ndevelopment of high school data science courses, curricula, and K-12 classroom\nsoftware. Today, over 70+ classroom resources are available for K-12 data\nscience education.\n\nIn 2019, an international consortium of researchers published the IDSSP\nFramework http:\u002f\u002fwww.idssp.org\u002f\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fwww.idssp.org\u002f__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!fez0eY781XaWo6XLag1nleyaWKEpO2B-QpIPbqFnWG_ZpMR2F0IPUpBP2W-xIahlb-EUQsO13HXxRKf56bo7CJjB$],\nforwarding a common framework for stand-alone high school courses across\ncountries.\n\nIn 2021, the Institute of Education Sciences released a Technical Working Group\nfor K-12 data science education, that highlighted significant opportunities for\nstudent engagement, greater diversity in STEM education, and additional research\nopportunities to forward the field. In my capacity as a former researcher for\nthe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences (IES), I\nhelped to gather evidence and diverse research expertise for this report, all\nwhich demonstrated significant potential value for students' mathematics\nlearning if scaled.\n\nIn 2022, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released\ntheir first national proceedings that cataloged a diverse array of K-12 data\nscience programs around the country. The report and commissioned papers\nhighlighted the uniquely strong student engagement, positive identity formation,\nand rigorous mathematical thinking that students gain from diverse curriculum\nprograms around the country \u2013 gathered through over 60 field-submitted\ncase-studies, educator interviews, and 6 expert panel discussions over two days.\n\nI am writing to share an additional research evaluation on high school data\nscience course programs in California (attached) that show relative gains for\nstudent attitudes toward mathematics, interest in STEM, confidence in STEM\nskills, and greater math course-taking when given the opportunity to enroll in a\nhigh school data science course. This study is pre-publication and still subject\nto peer review, but we are sharing now given the forthcoming framework decision\ndeadline. We believe this is yet another indication among many that K-12 data\nscience programs have strong potential to bring students into STEM pathways who\nwould not otherwise consider these options \u2013 providing students the motivation\nto learn additional mathematics in high school and higher education that is\nrequired for STEM degree programs.\n\nThe revised Framework is a first step toward building content equity in ensuring\nstudents have access to a variety of advanced, 21st century mathematics options.\nI fully support the Department\u2019s adoption of the proposed Chapter 5 addition.\n",

    "Comments": "This is a disgrace to our state and our students. California is\nalready behind in education and this will make us sink to the bottom. Equity\nmeans bringing everyone down to the lowest level. That is not promoting all\nstudents to be proficient in math. That is promoting no students being\nproficient. While this reduces our students viability in college and the\nworkplace it also reduces their ability to be successful in life. Our own\ncolleges will be skipping over our students for ones from other states who are\nqualified. If students do go to college with this type of education they will\ndrop out. We already have a high number of students that do not finish college\nbecause they were not prepared. The solution is not to under prepare thwm even\nmore. There is a mass exodus out of California and it will get bigger if this\nplan passes. Then you will not even have enough students in some areas to keep\nschools open. You need to scrap this plan and look at other states that are\nleading the way in this field and do that. The farther behind our students fall\nequals the farther behind our state falls. Vote no!",

    "Comments": "The California Math Framework was written by curriculum developers\nwho stand to financially benefit from being included. For example it promotes\nthe youcubed curriculum\u2026 which was created by Jo Boaler, one of the original\nauthors of the CMF\u2026 and which has never been evaluated in a peer-reviewed study.\nThis is a blatant conflict of interest.\n\nEven worse, the Framework lets districts deny bright kids the opportunity to\ntake algebra in 8th grade \u2014 which is a standard option most places on the\nplanet.\n\nIn SF, removing 8th grade algebra led to privileged parents finding workarounds\nor leaving public schools\u2026 while kids with no options fell behind their peers in\nneighboring districts. And the performance of Black and Latino kids hasn\u2019t\nmaterially improved \u2014 in fact, the performance gap has widened.\n\nIt has taken 10 years of advocacy to get the policy reversed (still working on\nit), and that\u2019s thousands of schoolchildren we left behind.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let other districts make our mistake. Every 8th grader should have\naccess to algebra, if they\u2019re ready for it.\n\nThank you.",

This math course pathway\ndiagram is essentially the same as San Francisco Unified School District\n(SFUSD). Both of these policies are already occurring at SFUSD, which also has\nas its basis a policy which delays Algebra I until 9th grade for all students,\njust as the Framework guides for. This is well known to the writers of the\nFramework as they explicitly referenced SFUSD in their first draft, but removed\nmention of it in the subsequent drafts after it was pointed to them that the\nsuccess claims of SFUSD were misrepresented. Disregarding this, although mention\nof SFUSD was removed with regard to the math pathway diagram, it is clear that\nthe math pathway diagram recommended by the Framework is substantially similar\nto that of SFUSD, as shown in the attachment, both the Framework and SFUSD have\nonly one path for students before 11th grade and delay Algebra I until 9th grade\nfor all students.

    "Comments": "The new proposed math framework is an abomination. Just teach math.\nMy daughter will not be enrolling her 4 year old daughter in public school,\nsince everything 'taught' there is so politicized. I agree with everything Palos\nverdes Peninsula School Board Member, Julie Hamill said below: f I were in\ncharge of creating a new math framework, I would look to places where children\nare excelling in math and borrow their strategies.\n\nMassachusetts, Utah and Idaho have the highest NAEP scores in Math. First\ngeneration Chinese immigrants in our community explained to me the drilling and\nrepetition they learned in school, and wonder why we cannot implement the same\nhere \u2013 because it works.\n\nInstead, California's proposed framework is heavy on critical theory and\npolitical buzzwords, light on actual math. It reads like an instructional manual\non social justice \u2013 not how to teach math.\n\nWhile this may appeal to those who identify with the far left, it repels\neveryone else, and FAILS THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY TEACHING MATH.\n\nThe stated focus is equity \u2013 for which there are no measurable objective\nbenchmarks. In fact, I did not find anything in the framework regarding how to\nmeasure success.\n\nThe framework defines equity as: \u201cfairness in education rather than\nsameness....equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access\nto tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes and\nsuccess in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4)\nAttention to relations of power.\u201d\n\nFirst of all - sameness is important in math. There is only one correct answer\nto a mathematical problem. That is how math works. Secondly - Do kids really\nneed to be focused on student identity development in math, or attention to\nrelations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is objectively\ninsane to me.\n\nFrom the overview: \u201cThe goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning\nso that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better\nunderstand and positively impact the world\u2014in their careers, in college, and in\ncivic life.\u201d\n\nFrom Chapter 1: \u201cReflecting the state\u2019s commitment to equity, every chapter in\nthis framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help\nmathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.\u201d\n\nEquity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2,\n9 and 10.\n\nThe framework is also focused on \u201cenvironmental literacy\u201d \u2013 which has nothing to\ndo with learning math.\n\nIn summary, the horse is out of the barn on this framework and I don\u2019t think\nanything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the office\nof superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. They are using their\npositions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas.\n\nMy recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new\nframework based on those that have proven successful \u2013 like those in\nMassachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters.\n\nInstead, our government has taken a non-political subject \u2013 MATH \u2013 heavily\npoliticized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for \u201cequity\u201d \u2013\nwhatever that means.\n\nHere is the framework: https:\u002f\u002fwww.cde.ca.gov\u002fci\u002fma\u002fcf\u002f\n\nPublic comments due tomorrow July 7 at noon here:\nhttps:\u002f\u002fwww3.cde.ca.gov\u002fsbecommentsform\u002fsbecommentsform1.aspx?m=sbe\n\nAs always, this is just one lady\u2019s opinion. I do not speak for the Board, and no\none else speaks for me.\n\n",

    "Comments": "I urge the CA State Board to accept the current draft of the 2023\nCA Mathematics framework. I agree with the premise that students should develop\nhabits of mind and habits of interaction described in the Standards for\nMathematical Practice.I approve of the framework\u2019s approach which includes \u201creal\nworld\u201d examples and use of data in problem solving. I agree that students'\nbenefit from opportunities to explicitly connect conceptual understanding with\nfacts and procedures in ways that make sense to them.\nIt is crucial for educators to encourage mathematical growth in students so that\nthey can persevere in learning beginning arithmetic and computation and advance\nto abstract subjects in algebra and geometry. We need this framework to help\nclassroom teachers deliver both basic concepts and math fact instruction and\nprepare our students to succeed in higher levels of mathematics.\nThank you.\n\n\n\n",

'Appendix A: Mathematical Progressions within the High School\nPathways' clearly places algebra in 9th grade. However, it is imperative to get\nto Calculus A prior to college for physics, math, or engineering majors, which\nrequires either algebra in 9th grade our doubling up on math in high school. I\nmajored in physics in college and those students that had not had calculus prior\nto college had major problems. Thank you.",

    "Comments": "I oppose the proposed California Math Framework, Version 3. In\nparticular, I do not support weakening the requirement that third graders master\nmultiplication. Multiplication accuracy must be continuously stressed in 3rd\ngrade, or else students will not be ready for division, fractions, and decimals\nin 4th and 5th grades. Automaticity in addition, subtraction, multiplication,\nand division is vital for understanding pre-algebra and pre-geometry. You cannot\nskip the 4 operations which are the building blocks of math. Permitting young\nstudents to use calculators during math in elementary or middle school is the\nessence of irresponsibility. Also, 8th grade Algebra should be offered in every\nmiddle school. Without 8th grade Algebra, students cannot take Calculus in 12th\ngrade without workarounds such as summer school, doubling up, etc. This is not\nfair to students who are ready to take Algebra by 8th grade. There should be\nhigh dosage tutoring offered at every CA public school during regular school\nhours so that C- or worse students who fall behind have help. It should be\nmandatory. Don't let students fall s-o-o far behind. Do not water down math\nstandards!! Is it Equity when high school students graduate without a firm grasp\nof arithmetic or Algebra 1? Is it Equity when they must take Remedial Math at\nCommunity College (which includes arithmetic and Algebra 1)? Is it Equity when\nSTEM careers are closed to them because they never mastered arithmetic\u002fAlgebra\n1?",

    "Comments": "The Framework should be rejected because the policies it is\nrecommending California adopt violate education codes. The Framework recommends\nin Chapter 8 line 701 \u201cFigure 8.4 below indicates possible pathways for high\nschool coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a\nbroader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade.\u201d Education codes EDC\n51224.7, EDC 51228.2, and EDC 51224.5 clearly articulate that:\n1) 9th grade math course placement is recognized as being very important in the\ncareers of students.\n2) It is expected that the math course placement of one student will differ from\nthe next. This is obvious because, if it was not, then there would be no need\nfor a \u201cMath Placement Act\u201d. If a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d was\nexpected, there would be no need to be concerned with placing students in\ndifferent classes. There would be no need for a \u201cMath Placement Act\u201d as students\nwould all be having a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d and be placed\nin the same class. That is, there would be no need to place students in\ndifferent classes. The law dictates students should be placed in different\nclasses based on their proficiency and have an experience substantially\ndifferent than some other students, and specifically, as dictated by law, not a\n\u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d.\n3) Fair and objective testing is required by law to be used to determine which\ncourse the student is to be properly placed in. This means it is expected that\nthe placement of one student will be different from the next, and a student is\nallowed to demonstrate which class he\u002fshe is to be properly placed in by\nperformance on a test, among other methods. This makes it illegal for districts\nto place all students in the same class which would be to impose a \u201ccommon\nninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d on its students .\nSince this Framework is guiding districts to impose an ILLEGAL policy on its\nstudents, the Framework must either:\n1) CLEARLY explain to districts that this is illegal.\n2) Excise from the Framework the parts of the Framework that guide districts\ntowards this ILLEGAL policy, that is remove the phrase a \u201dcommon ninth- and\ntenth-grade experience\u201d and all guidance associated with it.\n3) Not adopt the Framework. The State Board of Education must vote to not adopt\nthe Framework.\nSince the illegality of this wording in the Framework has been present in all\nthree drafts, and this has been clearly pointed out to the writers of the\nFramework in Public Comment, it is clear that this wording is both the intention\nof the Framework writers and that they continue to write this disregarding the\nknowledge of its illegality. This shows complete and utter negligence on the\npart of the Framework writers, a dereliction of duty, and therefore the best\nsolution is for the Framework to not be adopted and for the writing of the\nFramework be started over from scratch by a group of writers that are willing to\nnot guide districts to invoke policies that break the law.\n\n",

    "Comments": "Equity does not mean uniformity. Equity means equal access and\nsupport for all.\n\nThere are people who will write more eloquently than I have time to do given the\nshort window created for public response to this overhaul of California\nmathematics. But I want to be clear- we used the BIG IDEAS textbooks in my\nchildren\u2019s middle school this past year, and the students fell so far behind\npeers in other schools using more traditional textbooks that the our children\nbegan panicking. All were forced to use on line platforms to teach themselves\nthe material at home in their limited free time. Using their precious free time\n(which should be dedicated to extra curriculars, family, homework or relaxation)\nto learn the basics of geometry given that the BIG IDEAS textbook was so\nremedial, repetitive and insufficient.\n\nThe new framework is not based on data driven research. It has been uniformly\ncriticized by experts in mathematics and teachers.\n\nI dedicate my volunteer hours to increase equity and access for TSP students in\naccelerated gifted pathways. We need to improve very early education and gifted\nidentification. We need to allow our accelerated learners - from all economic,\ncultural and racial backgrounds- to have the support and encouragement they need\nin order to fulfill their potential.\n\nThe problems we face as a world are going to require great minds with advanced\neducations. We need stem innovators, we need students who are radically,\naccelerated in mathematics and all sciences. Our planet is broken and we need to\nbuild a generation of thinkers inventors and creators. We cannot do that by\nbelieving that equity equals uniformity. We must allow athletes to succeed in\nathletics, just as we allow mathematicians to succeed in mathematics. We don\u2019t\ncripple our fastest runners and it is undathomable to me that we celebrate a\ngymnastics prodigy but want to bridle and restrain a math whiz. This is anti\nintellectualism at its worst and most insidious.\n\nI\u2019m sure you are aware mathematicians do their greatest work in their 20s and\nearly 30s. We cannot hobble our youth by preventing them from accelerating in\nmath if that is something that they are willing interested and able to do. We\nwill drive our brightest into the private school sector. Furthermore, we will\nradicalized parents and send them to the far right. We are already seeing the\ncatastrophic affects of the radical right in much of California. However,\ninitiatives like the California math framework will push moderates to the right.\nSadly, only the right seems to be their ally in this argument, and that is\ndevastating. It will have a ripple effect into politics as well. All because\nCalifornia is taking the advice of a woman who should not only not be listened\nto, but who should be criticized and dismissed for her lack of ethics in\nmisrepresenting data and parading opinion as fact.\n\nWill we stop young children from reading novels if they are inclined to do so?\nThis is seeming very \u201cbrave new world\u201d to me.\n\nThe new math framework is an embarrassment to California. We are already lagging\nmany behind many other countries in stem. This new framework will aggravate the\nproblem. The fact that you are listening to the advice of someone who seems to\nbe inclined to be promoting her own textbooks and op-eds instead of listening to\nthe hundreds of mathematicians and stem professionals telling you that this is\nbad research is deeply troubling to me.\n\nAcceleration works. That fact is backed up by research across the board.\nTracking may or may not always work, but radical acceleration produces PhD\u2018s. It\nproduces patents. It produces scientists. This is proven. Denying acceleration\nto gifted children destroys their passion for education and it is cruel.\n\nWe need to offer the opportunity to accelerate to all of our students. And we\nneed to improve math education for those who are not accelerated. Most students\ndon\u2019t need calculus. Perhaps we need to rethink that. But we certainly need many\nof our students to learn calculus in order to succeed in fields that require it.\nAnd if those students want to learn calculus in fourth grade 8th grade 10th\ngrade\u2014Terrific. We need those kids; they\u2019re going to fix the world. ",

    "Comments": "This framework has grave errors that will impact California's\nworkforce competitiveness and exacerbate inequality between students in public\nschool systems and those who can afford private tutoring or private education.\n\nFlaws that I have serious concerns on\n* Movement away from evidence-based ways to learn math - especially fundamentals\nin memorization of operations and the foundational importance of algorithms\n* Taking away the ability for children to learn algebra in 8th grade does\nnothing to raise readiness of students and worsens equity instead makes access\nto advanced math only available to those who can pay for advanced studies\n\nPlease please reconsider to help ensure all Californian kids - especially those\nwho depend on public free education - have the best math learning available to\nthem and as strong a set of foundational learning opportunities as those with\nmore resources.",

    "Comments": "I understand and share your concerns as a concerned parent,\ncitizen, and 3rd generation resident of California. The proposed math framework,\nunfortunately, falls short in its objectives, serving political interests rather\nthan prioritizing the excellence in math education that our children deserve. It\nis crucial that we steer ourselves towards quantifiable goals, such as the NAEP\nmath assessments, which provide a reliable benchmark for measuring student\nproficiency. We should strive to achieve scores that meet or exceed results from\nkids in Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho.\n\nRegrettably, the current framework lacks the necessary clarity and foresight.\n\nI implore you to reconsider and adopt an alternative framework that places a\nstrong emphasis on objectivity and measurable outcomes. Our primary goal should\nbe to teach math in its purest form, devoid of any political influences. By\ndoing so, we can provide our children with a well-rounded education that equips\nthem for a future filled with opportunities.\n\nKids deserve a rigorous, flexible math curriculum that empowers them to excel,\nthink critically, and develop essential problem-solving skills through\nconsistent, routine practice.\n\nRegards",

It would benefit from a\nsupplemental chapter incorporating feedback from stakeholders in industry and\nhigher education detailing how much further proficiency of California's public\nschool students is likely to slide behind their peers in other states' and\nparochial schools should this framework be adopted.\nWhile I recognize that the guidelines provided to the committee do not\nprioritize providing all students the best mathematical foundation possible, I\nstrongly believe that our educational policies should strive for this goal. This\napproach could have been balanced with a healthy dose of skepticism towards the\nreferenced research and a commitment to scientific rigor.\nThank you for considering my comments. I urge the committee to take this\nopportunity to reassess and rewrite the current framework, addressing the\nconcerns raised, with the objective of ensuring it serves as a model of\neducational excellence.",

The State of California is becoming further\nbehind other states and countries in math yet we continue to ignore the fact\ncommon core is not the best model nor is the proposed rewriting of basic math\nteaching. I am appalled by the changes that are being recommended. It\u2019s becoming\nso convoluted we are having a hard time determining what subject is even being\ntaught anymore. Bring back the basic math model, high amount of repetition in\nbasic math facts in the younger grades sets an extremely strong foundation for\nlater math learning. Keep politics and social justice out of the classrooms.\nStudents are not equal academically and they never will be, please do not dumb\ndown our more aggressive learners to try to make the more challenged look\nbetter. Their are students that need extra help and that is ok. Repetition\nworks, I have done it for my children at home since the schools don\u2019t spend time\non this and it has helped them tremendously.",

Those families that have the means, or who\nare willing to make the sacrifice, will find away to get their children more\nadvanced work. ",

    "Comments": "Eliminating advanced math options hurts our students and hurts our\npublic school system. It hurts the students by not allowing those who are ready\nand eager to move ahead to do so. It removes the ability for our children to be\ntaught at the level that is right for them. We all know that one size does not\nfit all. It forces children to trudge along, killing any possible intellectual\nchallenge for the children who want more. It hurts our public school system\nbecause more and more parents will flee public education and enroll their\nchildren in independent charters, parochial schools, and private schools,\nfurther cementing the inequities that exist in public education and the\ninequities of which students remain in public education and what math classes\nthey have access to.",

    "Comments": "This framework has the possibility to positively expand student\nlearning, access, and experience in the math classroom for more students in ways\nthat the current and all the past framework has limited. Past frameworks have\nhistorically underserved marginalized communities. With the right support of\nteachers to implement, this framework has more access points for students of\nvariety of backgrounds that have not had the access in the past (language\nlearners, BIPOC, women, and more) through equity lenses. Students struggle to\nbecome what they cannot see or, if the material can\u2019t meet them where they are,\nthey miss out on the potential to further explore their world and become the\nfuture Mathematicians that we need them to be in whatever field they chose to\npursue. Furthermore, this framework does not diminish the opportunity for\nstudents who currently excel in their math progress, but it does challenge them\nto expand their thinking and build connections outside of math. This fluency and\nflexibility is vital to their success too. Many careers are not singularly\nconceptually focused (engineers aren\u2019t just running derivatives all day). This\nframework will challenge students to be build muscle around problem solving,\nresiliency, and mathematical processes to find solutions to complex problems. ",

    "Comments": "First of all, the committee is trying to ram this proposal through\nwith a public comment period just after school year ends when many people are on\nvacation, and allowing only a shambolic 2 week review period when there are more\nthan 1000 pages of material to be reviewed. Is the committee concerned about the\nunpopularity of the CMF that it is not willing to provide a reasonable public\ncomment period? This is akin to the White House trying to hide bad news from the\npublic by releasing it on a Friday evening.\n\nSecond of all, this CMF is baloney. The framework substantially reduces the\nrigor of the math curriculum so students can feel good about themselves for\nachieving more to a lower standard. This is merely creating an illusion for the\nstudents that they are achieving something when in fact they are merely falling\nfurther behind compared to other states, and other countries in the world. If\none wants to see what a rigorous math curriculum looks like, they can just get\nan elementary math book from Singapore, which is readily sold online in the\nUnited States, and one can see that by the fifth grade, Singapore students are\nalready at least 1 grade level farther along than the current common core\nstandard. And the CMF is reducing the rigor of the curriculum even further in\nthe name of 'helping more students'. An A achieved with a lower standard is just\nillusory achievement. The sense of accomplishment and belonging you are trying\nto instill is just as fake, and no different from giving everyone who\nparticipate in a sports competition a medal merely for participating.\n\nBesides the concerns I have of the CMF, I also have tremendous concern about how\nthe CMF was drafted. As of 2020, California is a highly diverse state with 40%\nLatino and 15% Asian. The CMF was drafted with heavy input from white math\neducation researchers who make recommendations on how math should be taught to\nthe colored communities, but these researchers have minimal exposure on actual\nday-to-day struggles of these communities, AND stand to profit handsomely from\ntheir consulting on math education\u002f framework with such communities. Case in\npoint, Jo Boaler and her $5000\u002f hr consulting with the Oxnard school district.\nThat is a blatant conflict of interest and needs to be called out as highly\nunethical.\n\nPlease fix the CMF by increasing the rigor of the curriculum, and before that,\nform a committee that reflects the current demographic makeup of the state.\n\nSampson Shen.",

    "Comments": "The Framework gives significant self-contradictory guidance on\nmiddle school acceleration paths that needs to be fixed before this Framework\ncan become policy. These are drastic revisions required or the Framework must be\nrejected.\nOne example is the Framework\u2019s description of a claimed middle school\nacceleration pathway on Chapter 8 line 825 (shown at the bottom), where a\nstudent Kai takes \u201cMathematics I and II in junior high and Mathematics III\nduring the first year of high school\u201d.\nIf this student is in a district with a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade\nexperience\u201d with Mathematics I starting in 9th grade, which is the district the\nFramework guides for in their math pathway diagram Figure 8.4 and accompanying\ndescription, the district would be forcing the student to repeat classes the\nstudent is already proficient in. This is illegal as defined by the education\ncodes EDC 51224.7, EDC 51228.2, and EDC 51224.5. Since, for a district that\nimposed a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d on its students with Math I\nstarting in 9th grade, this student Kai would not be able to move on in the math\npathway she is currently on because that district would have to offer a variety\nof classes to its 9th grade students including Mathematics I, Mathematics II,\nand Mathematics III, in short, not a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d\nwith Math I in 9th, it is clear that this pathway does not exist in a district\nthat adopts the Framework\u2019s recommendation of a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade\nexperience\u201d with Math I in 9th grade . The Framework needs to make it perfectly\nclear that this pathway is not possible in a district that adopts the Framework\nand the Framework\u2019s recommendation of a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade\nexperience\u201d with Math I in 9th. A public document cannot be misleading to\ndistricts.\nPhrasing needs to be inserted at the beginning of the section to clearly clarify\nthis to districts such that contradictory guidance is not given. It needs to be\namended, perhaps as follows:\nInsert above Ch 8, L 825:\n\u201cFor a district that does not impose a \u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade\nexperience\u201d with Math I in 9th on its students, and allows multiple student\npathways in grades before 11, especially those of acceleration where\nacceleration means enabling students to enroll in a class a grade level, or in\nthe case of the student described below, two grades levels above her peers, and\nespecially in middle school, in short, in a district that DOES NOT ADOPT the\nFramework, then the following example pathway is possible:\nThe above to inserted above the Framework quote C 8 L 825 repeated below:\n\u201cThe student Kai is interested in robotics engineering and was able to take\nMathematics I and II in junior high and Mathematics III during the first year of\nhigh school. By completing Precalculus in the second year, Kai is able to take\nAP Calculus in the third year. This enables multiple options for Kai\u2019s fourth\nyear, such as taking her school\u2019s data science course, or a programming and data\nscience course at the local community college, multivariable calculus, or other\ncollege courses.\u201d\nIt is obvious this student Kai lives in a district which has accelerated math\npathways in middle school. This pathway of Kai, and a district which has a\n\u201ccommon ninth- and tenth-grade experience\u201d with Math I starting in 9th grade as\nthe Framework guides for, are fundamentally self-contradictory. It is\nunacceptable to have a document that can affect so many children nationwide to\nbe fraught with obvious inconsistencies. A major revision is required or this\nFramework must not be approved.\n",

This framework puts too much effort into soft skills,\n'engagement,' 'cultural relevance,' and other issues that better belong in other\ndisciplines, and it is going to cost CA, and the nation, dearly. We will never\nknow how much mathematical genius we have squandered, and hindered with this\nframework, aimed at 'math appreciation' rather than mastery, equity rather than\nefficacy, and politics rather than proficiency.\n\nPlease do NOT adopt this framework.

    "Comments": "My eldest son, a person of color, grew up here in Serra Mesa, a\nneighborhood in San Diego, where our local high school, Kearny, is 89%\nnon-white. Until just recently when I began working full-time, we were a\nlow-income, working-class family.\n\nI set the context because I am appalled and saddened that California would want\nto punish someone like my son who was identified as profoundly gifted at age 6.\nHe *adored* math and began algebra at age 8, moving into geometry in 4th grade\nand calculus in middle school. Imagine if he was held back because of low\nexpectations. I would have crushed his intellectual curiosity. Instead, I let\nhim fly, pursuing what he loved, and he graduated from MIT 7 years ago debt-free\nbecause MIT was so generous with need-based aid.\n\nAs an ex-public school teacher who saw the writing on the wall early with my\nson, I chose to homeschool him because I knew he would be subjected to the\nbigotry of low expectations in public school.\n\nWe need to raise the bar for all children, but perhaps most particularly,\nstudents from under-represented groups! Lowing math standards would be a\ndisaster! California public education is already near the bottom of the country\nin results. We've strayed away from excellence in education and from teaching\nacademics. Please, please don't make it worse. The public school will continue\nto lose students unless it focuses on actually educating and helping\ndisadvantaged students *RISE* to the occasion rather than pulling everyone down\nwith low expectations.",

    "Comments": "I am writing to oppose the adoption of the 2023 Math framework.\nDespite being toned down in recent revisions it is still flawed at the core in\nits promotion of social justice throughout. It claims that each component of\nclassroom instruction is based on research and supported by practice, but let's\nexamine that. When it says that it is 'based on research', does this refer to\nresearch produced by education schools, which are broadly considered to be the\nintellectual dregs of academia? Why should this research be trusted? Last year I\ngot to talk with a student going for his educational doctorate who eventually\ndecided to leave the program. He said that his advisor had a long-standing\ntheory that she had worked so long on that any research that went against her\ntheory was no different than going against her personally, so that the only\nacceptable 'research' was that which further supported her theory. In other\nwords, don't expect to get your degree if your findings contradict my dogma. Is\nthat the sort of research we're talking about?\n\nHow about the second part? 'supported by practice'. What practice are these\ncomponents supported by? By 'practice' do you mean that these components are\nalready used in schools? Are these the same schools that keep getting worse and\nworse every year?\n\nIf 1) social justice has become increasingly a part of education based on\nresearch, and 2) students increasingly can't do math, why exactly should we\nlisten to that research? If students were doing better in math before social\njustice had been shoehorned into every nook and cranny of math education, why\nwould we double down on the idea? Research is only useful if it is falsifiable,\nand if researchers and practitioners are honest with themselves about whether\nsomething is working. You are not being honest with yourselves. The best way to\nmake these students to feel good about themselves is to give them general,\ntransferrable skills, not to try and tap into their emotions.\n\nStop trying to teach outside of your area of expertise. Many K-12 teachers are\nbarely competent to teach math, but at least they have some training in that.\nThey have no training in social work.\n\nStop trying to shove politics into our schools. Teach students how to think in a\ndisciplined, organized manner, and they'll have the tools to come to their own\nconclusions. We don't give you our children in order to indoctrinate them into\nwhatever weak ideologies your handful of years in our universities' weakest\nprograms indoctrinated you with.\n\n",

    "Comments": "Dear Members of the State Board of Education,\n\nI am writing to express my strong support for the adoption of the new California\nMathematics Framework, particularly with regards to its impact on elementary\nstudents and equity. I was part of the California Mathematics CFCC and am proud\nof the work that we created as a team as we kept equity at the front of center\nof our work. I sought to become part of the CFCC to provide clarity in the\nframework guided by the principles of equity to create better mathematical\nstructures and outcomes for our students.\n\nAs an elementary math coach, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by\nteachers in changing the math experience of students in their classrooms. The\nproposed changes provide comprehensive solutions to address these challenges and\nempower educators to create an equitable and meaningful learning environment for\nall students.\n\nChapter 1 lays a solid foundation by emphasizing the importance of mathematical\ncoherence and the sequential development of mathematical concepts. This chapter\nprovides clarity and guidance to teachers, enabling them to align their\ninstruction with the progression of mathematical ideas. As a math coach, this\nframework will serve as a valuable resource for me in supporting teachers as\nthey navigate the intricacies of building a coherent and robust mathematics\ncurriculum.\n\nChapter 2 focuses on mathematical practices, which are essential for developing\nstudents' mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. By explicitly\nhighlighting these practices, the new framework provides teachers with a\nframework for fostering critical thinking, communication, and collaboration\nskills among their students. As a math coach, I can utilize the framework to\nhelp teachers incorporate these practices into their instruction, thereby\nempowering students to become confident mathematical thinkers.\n\nChapter 3 addresses the critical need for differentiated instruction to cater to\nthe diverse needs of students. It provides strategies and resources to help\nteachers meet students where they are and support their individual growth. The\nframework acknowledges that students come from varied backgrounds and possess\ndiffering levels of prior knowledge. As a math coach, this chapter equips me\nwith practical tools to guide teachers in creating inclusive and equitable\nclassrooms where every student can access high-quality math instruction.\n\nChapter 4 emphasizes the importance of culturally responsive teaching in\nmathematics education. It recognizes that students' cultural backgrounds and\nexperiences play a crucial role in their mathematical understanding. By\nincorporating culturally relevant examples and contexts, teachers can foster\nstudent engagement and deepen their mathematical understanding. The framework\nequips me as a math coach to support teachers in creating culturally responsive\nclassrooms that celebrate diversity and promote a positive math identity for all\nstudents.\n\nChapter 5 focuses on assessment practices that are aligned with the principles\nof equity and student-centered learning. It emphasizes the use of formative\nassessment strategies to inform instructional decisions and provide timely\nfeedback to students. This chapter enables teachers to make data-driven\ninstructional choices, ensuring that all students receive the necessary support\nand intervention. As a math coach, I can help teachers implement effective\nassessment practices that promote equitable learning opportunities for all\nstudents.\n\nChapter 6, as previously mentioned, promotes a balanced approach to teaching\nmathematics by integrating procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. This\nchapter equips teachers with the tools to develop students' mathematical\nproficiency while fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts that\ncenters on \u201cBig Ideas.\u201d As a math coach, I can help teachers navigate this\nbalance and provide guidance on instructional strategies that promote both\nprocedural skills and conceptual understanding.\n\nChapters 9, 10, and 12 address the critical areas of technology integration,\nfamily engagement, and professional learning, respectively. These chapters\nrecognize the importance of leveraging technology, involving families in the\nmathematics learning process, and providing ongoing professional development\nopportunities for teachers. As a math coach, I can utilize the framework to\nsupport teachers in effectively integrating technology, fostering family\npartnerships, and accessing relevant professional learning opportunities.\n\nFinally, Chapter 13 is crucial as it provides guidance for curriculum publishers\nto create better instructional materials that center on big ideas, use tasks\nworthy of student engagement; and embed exercises in a larger context of\ninvestigation. The materials provided currently that reflect the 2013 framework\nrequire teachers to completely rearrange and piece components together to create\na program that somewhat resembles the direction that we should be going in\nmathematics education. These key changes in the materials that will result from\nthe new proposed framework will make the job of teachers so much easier.\n\nIn conclusion, the new California math framework addresses the pressing needs of\nelementary students and promotes equity in mathematics education. Its\ncomprehensive approach, coupled with specific guidance, provides me as a math\ncoach with a valuable tool to support teachers in transforming the math\nexperience of their students. The framework's ability to answer questions that\nwere previously unanswered by the previous framework will undoubtedly lead to\nimproved student outcomes and a more equitable mathematics education system.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I encourage the State Board of\nEducation to adopt the new California math framework for the benefit of all\nstudents across the state.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStephanie Holloway\nElementary Math Coach\nCalifornia Mathematics CFCC\n",

    "Comments": "I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised\nDraft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is\nimplemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known\nthat being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic\nsuccess in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or\nHispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or\nAfrican American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in\n2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down\nto 21% proficient or advanced in\n2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54). The CMF provides, at\nbest, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math\nclasses in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for\nstudents to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and\nimplemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial\nmeans will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the\npublic school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but\nsocio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who\nare often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to make progress in\nMath.\n\nFurthermore, it is disheartening to have California consider a framework that\nholds back students who are talented in mathematics and are ready to take\nCalculus in high school. It is inconceivable to imagine a similar framework\nproposed for young students who are talented in soccer, that will never happen\nbecause young students who are talented in soccer need to join teams that can\nfurther their talent. Same thing applies to Mathematics. Why is California\nproposing a framework that will hurt our most talented Mathematicians?\n\nThank you for your consideration,\nErika\n\n",

    "Comments": "Dear California State Board of Education,\nI am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)\nproposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California\nCommon Core Content Standards are being replaced with \u201cBig Ideas\u201d aligned to 4\n\u201cContent Connections\u201d which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor\nwritten by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the \u201cbig\nideas\u201d will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to\nrequire that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards\nadopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students\n(especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based\ninstruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards\nill-defined and vague \u201cbig ideas\u201d which have no guarantee of ensuring topics\nrequired for success in math are mastered.\nA California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: \u201cThis framework\nserves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for\nMathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013.\u201d\n(Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA\nmath content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly\nFAILED to do its job.\nIn direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you\nto reject recommends teaching \u201cBig Ideas\u201d as the content (see evidence below).\nWho decided the \u201cbig ideas\u201d should replace the content standards (which were\ncreated primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD\u2019s in MATHEMATICS and which\nwere vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)?\nAccording to the CMF, three individuals determined the \u201cbig ideas\u201d for\nCalifornia and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468\nwe read, \u201cThree big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and \u201cThree big\nideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high\nschool level call for students to do the following.\u201d Who are \u201cBoaler, Munson and\nWilliams\u201d who apparently have the authority to determine what students in\nCalifornia will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in\nmathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor\u2019s in Applied Mathematics). NONE of\nthe three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in\nmathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where \u201cbig ideas\u201d created by\nnon-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and\nvetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce;\nthe decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with\nadvanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers.\nAdditionally, the CMF tells us these \u201cbig ideas\u201d (chosen by three individuals\nwithout a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of\nbig ideas. \u201cIt should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas\nin mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation.\nProviding mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with\ncolleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their\ngrade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks\nthat invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas.\u201d (Ch 7 line\n952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards,\nwhy doesn\u2019t the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to",

    "Comments": "Dear California State Board of Education,\nI am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)\nproposed\nfor the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology,\nEngineering and\nMathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced\ncapabilities in\nmathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so\nthey can be\ncompetitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers.\nThe CMF\nprovides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher\nlevel math\nclasses in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for\nstudents to accelerate\nand get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead\nto greater\ninequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all\nof their education\noutside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but\nsocio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who\nare often 3-5\nyears below grade level with limited options to better their situation through\nSTEM.\nThe First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in\ntheir\nstatement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11.\nThere was NO\nmention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies\nwith false or\nmisleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the\nSBE did not\npass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third,\nversion now has\nsome wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an\noption. While\nprogress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that\nCLEAR Pathways\nbe recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current\nCMF is still\nvery much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as\nwell as keeping\nwith the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking\nfor high school\nstudents.\nThe CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade\nlevel\npeers until grade 11\n\u25cf The CMF describes \u201cheterogeneously grouped classrooms\u201d from \u201cgrade school\nthrough\nhigh school\u201d (Ch 1, line 208).\n\u25cf The CMF notes \u201cpossible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a\ncommon\nninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh\nand twelfth\ngrade.\u201d (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295).\nNote that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, \u201cThe framework recommends that all students\ntake the\nsame rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight.\u201d It is\nobvious that there\nare NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course\ntaking as two\nplaces say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently\nsome folks\nworking on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want\nno acceleration\nbefore grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration\nbefore grade\n9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in\na CMF that the\nSBE adopts\n\n1\n\n\u25cf As \u201cevidence\u201d for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11,\nthe CMF\nstates, \u201cAnother review of international evidence about tracking found that,\nwhile most\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not\ndifferentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those\nthat track\nstudents into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning\nsignificantly\n(Woessmann, 2009).\u201d (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other\ncountries\n(who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10,\nand yet\nthe CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in\nthis\nquote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from\nacceleration\n(Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not\nbeing allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There\nare very\ndifferent repercussions to students being moved to a different school while\ntheir peers\nare left at a \u201clower\u201d school than there are with the current policy in\nCalifornia where a\nstudent might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another\nmight\nbe in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one\nstudent\ntaking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics.\nStudents\nrecognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students\nand\nother aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math\nFramework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration\nbased upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of\nwhat it\nmeans to \u201caccelerate\u201d.\nWhat does non-acceleration look like?\n\u25cf Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade\n11, the\nCMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, \u201cWhen\ndifferentiation\noccurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced\nstudents, the\ncurriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced\ncourses\nlike calculus.\u201d (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade\nlevel\nstandards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and\nalso\nwith students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based\nupon the\nfact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in\n2021-22)\n(link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher\nreally\ngoing to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced\nstudents suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest\nstudents\nalso suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that\nexplains\nhow to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327),\nbut that\nrelies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses\nat\ntheir own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to\ncomplete\n\u201ccourses\u201d anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student\nmight\ncomplete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student\ncompleted\njust part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for,\nthen there\nneeds to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it\nwith\nevidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking\ncourses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on\ntranscripts\nand affects college admission, etc.\n\n2\n\n\u25cf In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School \u201cis a time when students\nmake\nchoices about mathematics coursework\u2014or have those choices made for them\u2014that\nhave long-term implications, including for their college and career\nachievements.\u201d (Ch 7\nline 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience\nuntil\ngrade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn\u2019t the CMF making choices for students that\nhave \u201clong\nterm implications\u201d, such as their not being competitive for college admission\ninto STEM\nmajors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private\nschools did\naccelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that\nis\nadopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle\nSchool AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to\naccelerate when ready.\nEvidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this\nproposal.\n\u25cf The CMF states, \u201cThese perceptions may also be linked to labels\u2014 \u201clow kids,\u201d\n\u201cbubble\nkids,\u201d \u201cslow kids\u201d \u2014that lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics\neducation for\nstudents, with some channeled into low level math.\u201d (Ch 1 line 243). First,\nsince when is\n\u201cdifferentiated math\u201d a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a\nteacher\nto differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fe.g.Ch__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!aPzV0y-pI8Klrs7S5hTSgZhNUXY4Zs8bp6Py-sFAOYNOpxzVy8lZumpdc-CN3Mi4CSecVWX2F464wZLsoJY$]\n8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in\nCalifornia has a \u201clow level\u201d math class (unless it is for SPED students). In\nCalifornia,\nthanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and\nstandardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through\nhigh\nschool. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra\nI or\nIntegrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man.\n\u25cf \u201cResearch indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all\nstudents to\ntake Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several\nstudies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread\nacceleration\noften led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that\nmost\nstudents who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score \u201cproficient\u201d on\nthe\nend-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed\neighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their\nninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST\nfor\nthe first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012).\u201d (Ch\n8 Line\n269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students\nshould be\nrequired to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts\nengaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a \u201chit\u201d on their\nAPI score\nwas horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no\none should\naccelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are\nthe only\noptions no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are\nready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many\nhigh\nperforming (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take\nAlgebra I in\ngrade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the\ntest that\nyear and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF\ndescribes a\nprogram where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So,\nhow\n\n3\n\ncan the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF\ndoes and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims?\n\u25cf Chapter 9 line 120 reads, \u201cFor many, this tracking begins in the early years\nof\nelementary school\u2014often around third grade.\u201d There is no citation here and NO\nevidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow\nacceleration in high\nschool, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing\nacceleration in grade\n6. It is just not the case that \u201cfor many\u201d acceleration (meaning taking a course\nabove\nyour current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5).\nThe \u201csolutions\u201d to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust\nand will\nharm socio-economically disadvantaged students\n\u25cf The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either\nAlgebra II or\nPre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. \u201cAn alternative to\neighth grade\nacceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating\nredundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need\nfour\ncourses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant\namount of\nthe content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II.\u201d (Ch\n8 line\n688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the\nCMF is\nproposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which\nstandards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to\ndevelop\nconceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world\ncontexts.\nWhile the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I,\nGeometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school,\nit also\nargues that students who don\u2019t accelerate in middle school are \u201cstuck\u201d. Chapter\n9 line\n121 reads, \u201cSchools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine\nstudents\u2019\nplacement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because\nstudents\nare then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways.\nThis\npractice is unjustifiable.\u201d I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to\ndetermine if a\nstudent can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school;\nhowever, this is another logical fallacy. Why can\u2019t some students accelerate in\nmiddle\nschool (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as\nproposed\nabove)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for\nstudents to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway\nthroughout\nmiddle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for\nexample\nIrvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino\nCounty). If\nwe truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM\ncareers,\nwe need flexible pathways starting in middle school!\n\u25cf The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. \u201cSchools may\nalso\norganize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who\nstart\nAlgebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high\nschool if they\nchoose.\u201d (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to\naccelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged\nstudents\nwho often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer.\n\n4\n\n\u25cf The CMF proposes \u201cdoubling up\u201d to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8\nline 819\nwe read, \u201cSo, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school\u2019s precalculus class,\nalong with\na half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in\nmathematics grows late in their high school time.\u201d Why does a student need to\nforgo an\nelective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career\nto take\nanother math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same\nclass\nuntil grade 11?\n\u25cf The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. \u201cOne form of flexible\ngrouping\ninvolves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later grades\u2014e.g.,\nfrom\nfourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth grade\u2014and supporting extra\ncourse-taking\noptions during the school year or during summer school so that students may\naccelerate\nat any time during middle or high school.\u201d (Ch 8 line 226) The public school\nsystem\nneeds to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take\nextra\nclasses or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as\nstudents\nwith financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs\nmet and\ntheir less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or\nwithout the\nopportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus.\nThe recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers\nexpectations, and\nas such, will harm CA students\n\u25cf The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take\nAlgebra\nII, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering\nexpectations\nrather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra\nII, thus\nkeeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730\nreads,\n\u201cIn addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the\nflexibility to offer\nother third-year and fourth-year courses.\u201d The SBAC only assesses high school\nstudents in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II.\nIf\nstudents do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high\npercentages. Rather\nthan providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards,\nthe CMF\nproposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that \u201cIf\nstudents take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II),\nthey\nshould be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus\nin\nhigh school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some\nuniversities for\nSTEM majors).\u201d (Ch 8 line 758)\n\u25cf The CMF points out that \u201cto meet the law\u201d students really only need Algebra I.\nChapter 8\nline 677 states, \u201cBy completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II,\n[1]\nstudents will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the\n2015\nlegislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses\nin order\nto receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course\nmeeting the\nrigor of Algebra I.\u201d The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF\u2019s\nattitude of\n\u201clowering the bar\u201d. Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra\nII; to enact\nthe CMF\u2019s proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which\nCalifornia has made great strides.\n\n5\n\nThe SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate\nbeginning in middle\nschool to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students.\n\u25cf In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually\npoints out\na major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students\ntend\nto get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with\nstudents\nwith a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, \u201cThe UC\nBoard of\nAdmissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS\ncommends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical\nconcepts taught at each K\u201312 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is\ncrucial for\ncollege coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough\ntime to\nmaster the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far\nmore\nimportant than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying\nconceptual\nknowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched level\u2014either\ntoo\nadvanced or too basic\u2014often become frustrated and lose interest in the topic.\n(BOARS,\n2016)\u201d\nClearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced\nfrom the\nchanging perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before\ngrade 11) to an\nattitude of It\u2019s possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I\nask the SBE to reject\nthis version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can\nbe explained\n(or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position\nto \u201cguide\u201d with\ntheir unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third\nversion) notes that more\ndiscussion is needed: \u201cIt would be helpful for the state to convene a working\ngroup of\nmathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways.\u201d (Ch 8\nline 245)\nStudents in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of\nmath (including\nCalculus) if they want. These opportunities to \u201caccelerate\u201d should be clearly\nmapped out in a\nCMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students\nto get on or\noff the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become\nlarger\nissues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math).\nThese pathways\nshould be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without\nhaving to\n\u201cdouble up\u201d and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice\nthey give districts;\nthe CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the\nCMF states\nnot before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class\nwithin a\nheterogeneous high school with \u201ctracking\u201d in other countries in which students\njoin entirely\ndifferent, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and\u002for\ncareers\nneed to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private\nschools. This\nCMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected.",

Our children need rigorous math education - this is the only path to equity\nand to equip all students to succeed in the future. The current draft of the\nframework dumbs down math education. As one example, this statement is\nlaughable: 'Attaining fluency with multiplication and division within 100\naccounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students\u2019 work.' This is\na pitifully low expectation. Many, many students are EAGER for challenges in\nmath and we are moving backwards. We need algebra in middle school, strong\ngeometry, trig, pre-calc and calculus in high school. Statistics is wonderful\nbut is not a substitution for calculus, which students need in order to be\ncompetitive in colleges.\nI urge you to reject this framework that rests in part on flawed data from the\nSFUSD - data that has been demonstrated to be inaccurate. Please revise the\nframework to set challenging goals and support students in reaching those\ngoals.",

    "Comments": "My wife and I deeply appreciate the time and effort you and staff\nput into the education of our future generations.\nBut proposed math teaching methodologies are diametrically opposed to the real\nworld where what you want is the right answer - quickly.\n\nMaking answers in sentences is simply making long responses (Kindergarten-Grade\ntwo: Example problem #3) and is not real world where 36 plus 25 has 25 on top of\n36 and you add: 5+6=11, write 1 and carry one over to the 3+2 column and 3+2 =5\n+ the 1 carried over = 61! That's real world - the one these kids will find in\ntheir employers 'Standard Operating Practices' manual. Not some circles equaling\n10s.\n\nSo parents who want their kids to learn math will adopt the methods of China and\nStates who exceed in testing - call it repetitive learning! Not what you will\npropose for our classrooms! But the ray of sunshine will be the teacher who\nlearned math in a 4 room farm community schoolhouse - repetitively - and will\nrepeat that method in addition to what you now want. Thank you for this time and\ngood luck!",

    "Comments": "Dear California State Board of Education:\n\nI wanted to draw your attention to a technical error in the third edition of the\nMathematics Framework that should be changed before vote and publication.\n\nChapter 9: Structuring School Experiences for Equity and Engagement includes a\nsection on Personalized Learning beginning on page 13. Within this section,\nwhich we are strongly supportive of, there is an example of our innovative\nlearning model which begins on page 15 starting with line 376 and continuing to\nline 378. It reads:\n\n\u201d376 A study of this model found that participating students improved at a\nfaster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than did a nationally\nrepresentative comparison group (Margolis, 2019).\u201d\n\nHowever, this study (Margolis, 2019) of our Teach to One model has been\nincorrectly attributed in to another example of a teacher-developed approach\nfrom Modern Classroom which starts on line 372:\n\n\u201c372 In one successful teacher-developed approach, students engage in blended,\nself-paced, mastery-based learning with teacher-made videos supplementing\nin-class problem-solving individually and in collaborative groups, with\ncontinual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and\ncompetence (Modern Classroom, 2021). A study of this model found that\nparticipating students improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics\nassessments than did a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis,\n2019).\u201d\n\nIt should instead read (as it did in draft two) :\n\n\u201c372 In one successful teacher-developed approach, students engage in blended,\nself-paced, mastery-based learning with teacher-made videos supplementing\nin-class problem-solving individually and in collaborative groups, with\ncontinual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and\ncompetence (Modern Classroom, 2021). A similar model developed by a middle\nschool teacher and now taught in many schools, uses diagnostic assessments to\ncreate a tailored set of assignments for each student that the teacher can use\nin technology-infused mix of direct instruction, collaborative work with peers,\nand individualized learning. A study of this model found that participating\nstudents improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than\ndid a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis, 2019).\u201d\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to comment on the third draft of the Mathematics\nFramework and bring this technical error to your attention.\n",

    "Comments": "We at San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools write this\nletter in support of the 2023 Mathematics Framework. We feel that this Framework\nis necessary to support mathematical achievement for all of our students. We\nagree with the authors\u2019 compelling argument that we cannot afford any inaction\nor keep the status quo of mathematics teaching and learning.\n\nThe mission of San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools is to transform\nlives through education. This is in alignment with the goal of the framework to\n\u201censure equity and excellence in math learning so that all California students\nbecome powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact\nthe world.\u201d\n\nWe are appreciative of the time and effort that was taken by the writers to take\nthe call to action along with the current requirements of the Board of Education\nto create a document that views equity so important in this day and age. We\nappreciate the time and resources in producing a document that is consistent in\nlanguage, organization and formatting.\n\nWe look forward to using this document as a support for Educators, a place to\ncalibrate and deepen our understanding of the teaching and learning of\nmathematics for the students of California.\n\nThank you,\nMelanie Janzen, Math Curriculum Coordinator\nPriscilla Rice, Math Curriculum Coordinator\nAndrea Barron, Math Curriculum Specialist\n\nSan Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools",

The very students who will be harmed by this measure (and there\nare large numbers of them) are those minority students who have the ability to\ndo algebra in the 8th grade but are told it is too difficult for them. What kind\nof a message is that? It is promoting a race to the bottom instead of helping\nstudents to excel. This has not worked in San Francisco - the results are dismal\n- so now you want to enact it state wide?

I incorporated much of what was in this\nchapter into a professional learning series aimed at energizing and motivating\nteachers to plan their instruction around these practices.\nThe throughline of focusing on equity in this framework is just what we need in\nour schools right now.

CA needs to go back to the drawing\nboard ASAP. \u201cThe guidelines are based on statutory requirements, feedback from\nfocus group meetings in August of 2019, student focus groups in September and\nOctober 2019, information provided by the Instructional Quality Commission and\nthe State Board of Education, and public comment.\u201d\n2. Although this is a laudable goal it has NOTHING to do with teaching math.\n\u201cThe CFCC shall include ample concepts and strategies throughout the grade-level\nchapters to support universal access and ensure access, equity, and inclusion\nfor all students.\u201c\n3. NAEP math scores have plunged in CA. CA fails to include discussion of\nbringing up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the NAEP\nproves.\n4. The insertion of equity discussion does not belong in Math class but rather\nin social sciences.\n5. There is NO provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math\nclass as a discussion class on equity.\n6. UDL contractual agreement to teach math is not going to raise math scores or\nmath competency.\n7. NAEP scores lowest in a decade. Where is the math proficiency component in\nthe math framework.\n8. More significantly, perhaps, the amount of 13-year-olds deemed proficient or\nbetter in math went from 34 percent in 2019 to just 26 percent today.\n9. In math scores went from terrible to worse: 41 percent proficient in 2019, to\njust 36 percent proficient in 2022\n10. The NAEP reading proficiency was also stunningly low: 37 percent in 2019,\ndown from 40 percent in 1998.\n11. Students will continue to fail if CA refuses to address actual proficiency\nin math and reading. CA fails to provide the plan for students who are failing\nand provide for those students who are able to proficient and able to take\nadvanced classes.\n",

    "Comments": "I am writing to express my concerns with the revised draft (v3) of\nthe CA Mathematics Framework. I am also a California resident and a parent that\ncares deeply about education. I am a Computer Scientist, I teach college courses\nin data science and computer science and I have a solid understanding of the\nfoundations needed for success in college-level STEM. I am also an experienced\nresearcher and understand how to use data, evidence, and citations. I am very\nconcerned with this draft.\n\nThe revised version corrected some of the issues in v2. In particular, the MIC\npathway (that was ill defined and should have never been there) was removed. But\nmany glaring issues remain and few new ones were added. Most importantly, the\ndocument is very far from being useful and seems ideology-driven rather than\nevidence and research-based. It does not follow basic standards of scholarship.\n\nThe stakeholders (students, parents, school districts, colleges, industry)\nexpect and deserve a guidance document that is done professionally, that\nincludes a careful synthesis of the education literature, and a review of best\npractices that work. The draft is a mockery of scholarship. Statements are being\nwritten with citations that frequently do not support the statements. Other\ncitations are not to scholarly documents but to opinion pieces that make\nnon-verifiable and sometimes egregious claims. At other occasions there is solid\nresearch that supports the opposite recommendation that is just being completely\nignored. This is unacceptable.\n\nAnother issue is the conflict-ridden UC area-C loophole, where courses that have\nvery little math content were approved as \u201cadvanced math courses\u201d that validate\nAlgebra 2. The CMF earlier drafts were part of a mass campaign that deceived CA\nstudents and families with regard to the preparation needed for college-level\nSTEM. The current v3 draft retracted some of this hype (removed the\nfalsely-represented MIC pathway), but some of the hype remains. It is rather\nastonishing and unacceptable that the v3 draft still alludes to the faulty\napproval of these courses (a careless mistake at best) as a way to promote false\nideas.\n\nThe v3 draft made cosmetic and wording changes and still ignored many of the\nissues that were previously pointed out painstakingly by Brian Conrad and\nothers. At this point it seems clear that the issues can not be simply fixed by\naddressing specific comments. Careful review and addressing in a sincere way all\ncomments by Professor Brian Conrad, Mike Lawler and Tom Loveless will only get\nus part of the way. To create a helpful document, a new writing team needs to\nwrite the document from scratch.\n\nFinally, the time given to the public to review the 1000 pages draft, with so\nlittle warning, is insufficient. Especially for a document that is so far from\nbeing acceptable.\n\nI hope you will take responsibility for our students and all stakeholders and\nreject the current draft.\n",

The 2022 and 2023 CMF drafts do\nneither, and thus we have a much improved but still controversial 900+ page\ndocument that creates an awkward and cumbersome framework consisting of 'drivers\nfor investigation,' 'content connections,' the CA-CCSS-M mathematical practice,\nand 'big ideas.' However, the interaction of the big ideas and the other\ncomponents (DI's, CC's, MP's) is unclear. Moreover, the big ideas seem to\nreplace the CA-CCSS-M (at least on the student facing side) which may be an okay\nidea if on the teacher side the connections are clear. Unfortunately, the 900\npages of the framework fail to make those connections in the crucial and\ncontroversial area of Algebra 2 and Integrate 3.

    "Comments": "Dear California State Board of Education,\n\nI am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF)\nproposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology,\nEngineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students\nwith advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as\nCalculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success\ninto college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear\npathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the\nK-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to\naccelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the\nCMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek\nmath acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system,\nleaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged\npeers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade\nlevel with limited options to better their situation through STEM.\n\nThe First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in\ntheir statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade\n11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and\nin fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of\nthese arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second\nversion of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in\nat least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress\nhas been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR\nPathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the\ncurrent CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate\nuntil grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of\nlowering overall math course taking for high school students.\n\nThe CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade\nlevel peers until grade 11\nThe CMF describes \u201cheterogeneously grouped classrooms\u201d from \u201cgrade school\nthrough high school\u201d (Ch 1, line 208).\nThe CMF notes \u201cpossible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common\nninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh\nand twelfth grade.\u201d (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295).\n\nNote that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, \u201cThe framework recommends that all students\ntake the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight.\u201d It\nis obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about\nacceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10\nand one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was\nevidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11,\nbut someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9.\nThis confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a\nCMF that the SBE adopts\nAs \u201cevidence\u201d for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the\nCMF states, \u201cAnother review of international evidence about tracking found that,\nwhile most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\ncountries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or\ntenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier\nincrease inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009).\u201d (Ch 9, Line\n148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far\noutperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the\nCMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this\nquote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from\nacceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT\nSCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same\nschool. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a\ndifferent school while their peers are left at a \u201clower\u201d school than there are\nwith the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced\nmath class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but\nthen advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary\narts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize,\noften as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other\naspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math\nFramework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration\nbased upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of\nwhat it means to \u201caccelerate\u201d.\nWhat does non-acceleration look like?\nSince all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11,\nthe CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, \u201cWhen\ndifferentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of\nadvanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students\nto reach advanced courses like calculus.\u201d (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students,\n1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to\nstudents who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below\ngrade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th\ngraders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of\nstudents below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach?\nIf the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer\nand lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also\nsuffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that\nexplains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line\n327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each\nstudent progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations,\nand students able to complete \u201ccourses\u201d anytime during the year and progress to\nthe next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in\none year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the\nmath instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly\nmore time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an\nexplanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some\nover 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and\naffects college admission, etc.\nIn Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School \u201cis a time when students\nmake choices about mathematics coursework\u2014or have those choices made for\nthem\u2014that have long-term implications, including for their college and career\nachievements.\u201d (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a\ncommon math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn\u2019t the CMF making\nchoices for students that have \u201clong term implications\u201d, such as their not being\ncompetitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as\ntheir peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)?\nThis CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give\nCLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High\nSchool so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready.\n\nEvidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this\nproposal.\nThe CMF states, \u201cThese perceptions may also be linked to labels\u2014 \u201clow kids,\u201d\n\u201cbubble kids,\u201d \u201cslow kids\u201d \u2014that lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics\neducation for students, with some channeled into low level math.\u201d (Ch 1 line\n243). First, since when is \u201cdifferentiated math\u201d a bad thing? The CMF has stated\nhow essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__http:\u002f\u002fe.g.Ch__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!doJIn0oSXS3nuOnlC4H_lVgbYdCtnvx2XONJsFTWS4nxv4RQiNHu4FzV1HcI1fLOdfbeHtMWOo9GKDr-QoKDh3Q_$]\n8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a \u201clow level\u201d math\nclass (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California\nMath Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing\n(SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are\nhardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated\nMath I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man.\n\u201cResearch indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all\nstudents to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was\nundermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements,\nwidespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics\nachievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth\ngrade failed to score \u201cproficient\u201d on the end-of-course Algebra California\nStandards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the\nAlgebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average\nthan students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth\ngrade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012).\u201d (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate\nstatement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to\naccelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in\nby placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a \u201chit\u201d on their API score\nwas horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no\none should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues\nfor? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What\nabout those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period\ndescribed above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive\nabout who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all\nstudents achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In\naddition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all\nstudents in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how can the SBE\nadopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and\npropose large scale changes based upon these false claims?\nChapter 9 line 120 reads, \u201cFor many, this tracking begins in the early years of\nelementary school\u2014often around third grade.\u201d There is no citation here and NO\nevidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow\nacceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very\nfew allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that \u201cfor many\u201d\nacceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in\ngrade 3 (or even 4 or 5).\n\nThe \u201csolutions\u201d to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust\nand will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students\nThe CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra\nII or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. \u201cAn alternative\nto eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum\ninstead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that\nstudents do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends\nto repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus\nrepeats content from Algebra II.\u201d (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter\n8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they\nshould map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be\naddressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual\nunderstanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts.\n\nWhile the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I,\nGeometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school,\nit also argues that students who don\u2019t accelerate in middle school are \u201cstuck\u201d.\nChapter 9 line 121 reads, \u201cSchools sometimes use elementary school test data to\ndetermine students\u2019 placement, which typically also determines their ultimate\ndestination. Because students are then taught different content, they often\ncannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable.\u201d I agree\nwholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a\nSTEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is\nanother logical fallacy. Why can\u2019t some students accelerate in middle school (if\nthey show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed\nabove)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for\nstudents to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway\nthroughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options\n(for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San\nBernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the\nopportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in\nmiddle school!\nThe CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. \u201cSchools may\nalso organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students\nwho start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in\nhigh school if they choose.\u201d (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to\nsummer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically\ndisadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings\nduring the summer.\nThe CMF proposes \u201cdoubling up\u201d to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8\nline 819 we read, \u201cSo, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school\u2019s\nprecalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers\nfor students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school\ntime.\u201d Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might\nhelp them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the\nCMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11?\nThe CMF proposes students can take extra courses. \u201cOne form of flexible grouping\ninvolves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later grades\u2014e.g.,\nfrom fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth grade\u2014and supporting extra\ncourse-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that\nstudents may accelerate at any time during middle or high school.\u201d (Ch 8 line\n226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra\nburden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra\ntime will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the\npublic school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will\nbe stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate\nand reach Calculus.\n\nThe recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers\nexpectations, and as such, will harm CA students\nThe CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take\nAlgebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is\nlowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students\nto succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees\nand careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, \u201cIn addition to offering Mathematics III\nor Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and\nfourth-year courses.\u201d The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11,\nand a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not\ntake Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than\nproviding supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the\nCMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that\n\u201cIf students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra\nII), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for\ntaking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is\nexpected in some universities for STEM majors).\u201d (Ch 8 line 758)\nThe CMF points out that \u201cto meet the law\u201d students really only need Algebra I.\nChapter 8 line 677 states, \u201cBy completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics\nI and II,[1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill\n220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two\nmathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high\nschool, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I.\u201d The SBE and\nCalifornia should not be okay with the CMF\u2019s attitude of \u201clowering the bar\u201d.\nNearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the\nCMF\u2019s proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which\nCalifornia has made great strides.\n\nThe SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate\nbeginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined\nstudents.\nIn a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually\npoints out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math\nstudents tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a\nclass with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877\nwe read, \u201cThe UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a\nsimilar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding\nof the mathematical concepts taught at each K\u201312 grade level. A strong grasp of\nthese ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students\nshould be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an\nindividually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into\nadvanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed,\nstudents whose math classes are at a mismatched level\u2014either too advanced or too\nbasic\u2014often become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)\u201d\n\nClearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced\nfrom the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration\nbefore grade 11) to an attitude of It\u2019s possible, but not desired, to accelerate\nin Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear\npathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any\nmention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to \u201cguide\u201d with\ntheir unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third\nversion) notes that more discussion is needed: \u201cIt would be helpful for the\nstate to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify\npossible high school pathways.\u201d (Ch 8 line 245)\n\nStudents in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of\nmath (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to \u201caccelerate\u201d\nshould be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry\npoints and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways\nthroughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students\nneed challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should\nbe built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having\nto \u201cdouble up\u201d and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice\nthey give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before\ngrade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds\naccelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with\n\u201ctracking\u201d in other countries in which students join entirely different,\nhomogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and\u002for careers\nneed to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private\nschools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Comments": "In the FAQ section under the topic of 'access to calculus in high\nschool', I know of a school district that limits 8th-grade enrollment to\nAlgebra, a prerequisite to calculus. Out of 800 8th-grade students, only 120\nspaces were provided for algebra. I recommend that the State Board of Education\ndevelop requirements to encourage increased access to Algebra.\n\nChapter 9: Structuring School Experiences for Equity and Engagement - 'slow' vs.\n'speed' was discussed. The discussion did not address the situations when 'slow'\nis necessary and 'fast' are required. It is similar to riding a bicycle, we\nstart out slow, and through practice, we are able to ride 'fast' without even\nthinking about the riding process. Students can learn to be 'fast' in basic\nmath. When facing a complex problem, 'slow' is definitely the best approach. The\ndiscussion in Chapter 9 does not address the need for students to become 'fast'\nfor basic math such as multiplication. I volunteered as a tutor in a\ncontinuation program. The students needed calculators to figure out what is 8X7.\nI gave them a multiplication table to practice on. They have to learn to ride\nwithout training wheels (calculators). Another example of 'fast' vs 'slow', if I\nam asked what is d x2 \u002fdy, I should be able to give the answer instantly and not\nhave to take the 'slow' approach.\n\nGeneral questions - The US is behind on math compared to the rest of the world.\nAnd CA is below US average. That is a rather sad state of affairs. Will the CDE\nmonitor the results from this new math framework on a regular basis, and publish\nthe results? And will the CDE require local school districts to do likewise?\nWithout the publication of results, this exercise of proposing a math framework\nis rather meaningless. And how will the CDE respond if the framework produces\nnegative results? Will the CDE change the framework quickly?",

    "Comments": "If I were in charge of creating a new math framework, I would look\nto the states and countries that are excelling in math. Massachusetts, Utah and\nIdaho have the highest NAEP scores in Math. First generation Chinese immigrants\nexplained to me the drilling and repetition they learned in school, and wonder\nwhy we cannot implement the same here \u2013 because it works.\n\nThe framework is heavy on critical theory and political buzzwords, light on\nactual math. It reads like an instructional manual on social justice \u2013 not how\nto teach math.\n\nThe main focus is equity \u2013 for which there are no measurable objective\nbenchmarks. In fact, I did not find anything in the framework regarding how to\nmeasure success. If anyone else found that part, please tell me.\n\nThe framework defines equity as: \u201cEquity. Equity refers to fairness in education\nrather than sameness. Drawing from Gutierrez (2012), equity includes four\ndimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access to tangible resources; (2)\nParticipation in quality mathematics classes and success in them; (3) Student\nidentity development in mathematics; and (4) Attention to relations of power.\u201d\nDo we really need to be focused on student identity development in math, or\nattention to relations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is\nobjectively insane to me.\n\nFrom the overview: \u201cThe goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning\nso that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better\nunderstand and positively impact the world\u2014in their careers, in college, and in\ncivic life.\u201d\nFrom chapter 1: \u201cReflecting the state\u2019s commitment to equity, every chapter in\nthis framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help\nmathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.\u201d\nEquity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2,\n9 and 10.\n\nIt\u2019s also focused on \u201cenvironmental literacy\u201d \u2013 which has nothing to do with\nlearning math.\n\nIn summary, the horse is out of the barn on this math framework and I don\u2019t\nthink anything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the\noffice of superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. It is not surprising\nthat they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas.\n\nMy recommendation would be to completely scrap this entire framework and model a\nnew framework based on those that have proven successful \u2013 like those in\nMassachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters.\n\nInstead, our government has taken a non-political subject \u2013 math \u2013 heavily\npoliticized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for \u201cequity\u201d \u2013\nwhatever that means.

This does not diminish rigor, as some claim.\nIf California is to keep its place as an economic world leader, it must keep up\nwith countries and US states that let math education pump graduates INTO the\nworkforce, not filter them OUT. Our previous system only has the benefit of\nkeeping established math professors in their comfort zones, unchallenged in\ntheir superiority.

    "Comments": "In Ch. 1, of the CMF, lines 610-619, it is stated \u201cProblems (tasks\nwhich students do not already have the tools to solve) precede teaching of the\nfocal mathematics necessitated by the problem. That is, the major point of a\nproblem is to raise questions that can be answered and encourage students to use\ntheir intuition to address the questions before learning new mathematical\nideas.\u201d\n\nI strongly oppose the recommendation of what is otherwise known as \u201cproductive\nstruggle\u201d. First, in the website for the Common Core Math Standards, it states\nthat the standards do not require specific pedagogies, but CMF is certainly\ndoing that. Secondly, current research does not support such strategy;\nspecifically, see https:\u002f\u002flink.springer.com\u002farticle\u002f10.1007\u002fs10648-019-09500-5\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__https:\u002f\u002flink.springer.com\u002farticle\u002f10.1007\u002fs10648-019-09500-5__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!bBf1J4hsUe4yU2Hak8rGn5Q7_RazbAYWGya6UFGfttIXe7ZP9N3Cvy1Iu_7SsVEuCCM3JTGZByFp2edBVZ4$].\nIn this study, Ashman, et al, concludes that 'For learning where element\ninteractivity is high, explicit instruction should precede problem-solving.'\n\n\n\n",

To make matters worse, there was no prior notification or updates\nregarding the Schedule of Significant Events, with no modifications made to that\npage since July of 2022. Suddenly, a colossal 1006-page document materializes on\nthe website in late June. This disregard for transparency and public input is\nespecially outrageous considering the multitude of issues identified in the\nprevious draft.\n\nDuring the second field review, numerous problems were exposed within the\ninitial draft. These issues range from misrepresented citations and\nmisconceptions about the requisite math skills for contemporary college degrees\nin both STEM and STEM-adjacent fields to an inadequately developed Data Science\npathway, which clearly has no rightful place in this framework. Additionally,\nthe draft presented flawed opinion-based recommendations concerning high-school\npathways, acceleration, equity, technology, assessment, and placement.

    "Comments": "Are we there yet?\n\nA new framework was adopted in 2013 which replaced California's 'Algebra for all\nin 8th grade' policy. A lot of misinformation was disseminated to say that\nCalifornia students were not doing well in Algebra 1 by using 'repeat rates'\ninstead of failure.\n\nA circus shell game if ever there was one. Students had to pass the Algebra 1\nCST (old STAR system) and receive a C in order to be promoted to Geometry. The\nEd Code changed in 2016 *and* the math placement act also was enacted to stop\nforcing students to repeat classes based on test scores if they had already\npassed the class. It is nonsense to use data pre 2013 as a comparison to post\ncommon core.\n\nHowever? We do have an on going experiment in San Francisco based on Dr.\nBoaler's recommendations, many which are in this framework. And in fact this\nframework reads like an informercial for Youcubed, her Stanford 'non profit'.\n\nSan Francisco did not track previously, everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 8th\ngrade. In 2014 everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 9th grade. There was no\nimprovement in grades. What did happen is the underserved communities lost\naccess to higher math Precalculus enrollment did not increase. SFUSD lied about\ntheir compression class, calling it Algebra 2 + Precalculus but UC a-g rejects\nit as a precalculus class and gives Algebra 2 credit. This under preparation\nharms students.\n\nDiversifying STEM is extremely important. This framework does not accomplish\nthis goal. It will increase opportunity gaps as the resourced supplement.\n\nThe 'Sold a Story' podcast (literacy) should be required listening because we're\nabout to do the same thing in math.\n\nSFUSD stands as a warning beacon to all that pass. Do not do this. It has\nfailed. Let's not wait 10 years and say 'ooops'.\n\nThis is not a holodeck simulation. Real people's lives are at stake. We cannot\nafford to leave BIPOC students behind as SFUSD has done.\n\nPlease reject this and rewrite it with true equity in mind. Not superficial\nhallmark card sentiments. ",

    "Comments": "The prior drafts of the CMF had serious problems with accurate and\nappropriate references. Claims that have been removed from prior drafts include:\n\n(i) The repeat rate in San Francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to\n9th grade fell from 40% to 8%, and\n(ii) Most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math\n\nProblems with references continue with this draft. My recommendation is that all\nreferences that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either\nremoved or replaced with proper references. If they cannot be replaced, the\nitems in the CMF that depend on the non-academic references need to be removed,\ntoo. I'll provide two examples of non-academic references below that should be\nremoved, but these are just two examples to make the point clear. All of the\nnon-academic references need to be examined carefully by the California\nDepartment of Education.\n\nFor example, the Boaler, Munson, and Williams reference from Youcubed - What is\nMathematical Beauty - is not academic research and ends with an advertisement\nfor books written by the authors. As Boaler is also an author of the CMF, having\na reference advertising her books included in the CMF is inappropriate.\n\nA second example is the Boaler and Foster paper on Youcubed - Raising\nExpectations and Achievement. Again, this is not academic research. The paper\nhas a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the CMF as political. It\nis inappropriate to have a reference in the CMF criticizing opposition to the\nCMF. This paper also discusses a study - referred to as 'study 2' in the paper -\nthat compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015. This\ncomparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student\nachievement from a score difference on an Algebra II test one year and an 8th\ngrade math test in the next year. This reference to the study in this paper in\nChapter 9 of the CMF goes even farther to state (without reference or\nexplanation) that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling.\n\nThe claims about 'study 2' in chapter 9 of the CMF are an example of important\nclaims in the CMF (in this case, tracking) that are not backed by published\nacademic research. Again, this reference - and all non-academic research cited\nin the CMF - needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic\nresearch. As this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015, there\nhas been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores. If the only\ndiscussion of these exam scores is the post on Youcubed, this reference and the\ndiscussion about tracking supported by it, needs to be removed.\n\nThere are millions of students in California whose lives will be affected by the\nCMF It is the responsibility of the California Department of Education to ensure\nthat the ideas in the document are supported properly. Non academic work like\nblog posts, books, or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as\nacademic work. The inclusion of advertisements and political statements about\nopposition are obviously not appropriate references. Non-academic studies cannot\nbe central to the CMF's proposal either.\n\nOnce the references are corrected (or the material removed), what remains in the\nCMF can be evaluated properly.",

    "Comments": "As a parent of three kids in the public school system in\nCalifornia, I'm writing to express my concern with Version 3 of the California\nMath Framework. Specifically, I'm concerned with the promotion of a for-profit\ncurriculum (YouCubed) that lacks robust research evidence and runs counter to\nthe wisdom of many STEM teachers and researchers. I fear that this move will put\nCalifornia students further behind in math. People with privilege (myself\nincluded) may be able to compensate by teaching our kids ourselves or enrolling\nthem in supplemental programs, whereas families without those resources are\nvulnerable to widening disparities in math achievement and fluency as a result\nof this misguided effort.\n\nAdditionally, I am concerned about the removal of Algebra as an option for 8th\ngraders who are ready for it. Providing opportunities for STEM advancement in\npublic schools is one the greatest gifts we can give our kids. Please do not\nshortchange California public school students. ",

    "Comments": "I find it unconscionable that the public would be given only 11\ndays to review and comment on the revised draft of this framework, a period\ncontaining a Tuesday federal holiday, no less. There was no advance notice or\nupdates to the Schedule of Significant Events provided (no changes made to that\npage since July of 2022), and a 1006 page document simply appeared on the\nwebsite in late June. This is particularly egregious in light of the multitude\nof problems found in the prior draft.\n\nThe second field review exposed many issues in that draft, including those of\nmisrepresented citations, misconceptions about the math skills required for\ncontemporary college degrees, both in STEM and STEM-adjacent fields, a\nmathematically anemic Data Science pathway that had no business being part of\nthis framework in the first place, and faulty opinion-based recommendations\nrelated to high-school pathways, acceleration, equity, technology, assessment,\nand placement. These issues are on record in the SFR public comments from Brian\nConrad, Maya Keshavan, Edith Cohen, Jelani Nelson, and others.\n\nIn my preliminary reading of this 2023 draft, I've found the same statements of\nopinion, many of them reworded to sound slightly less objectionably mistaken,\nand often with no evidence cited whatsoever. Misrepresented citations still\nappear, even though Brian Conrad had pointed them out in painstaking detail, and\nthe CMF assertions for those that were removed still remain in the revised\ndocument.\n\nChapter 8 illustrates 'pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common\nninth- and tenth-grade experience,' and this experience puts Algebra 1 squarely\nin 9th grade (not 8th), even though the Superintendent of San Francisco Unified\nSchool District has announced that this plan has failed after 10 years of shoddy\nproficiency performance, and families are clamoring to have the district bring\nback Algebra in 8th grade.\n\nThe cited evidence being used to support nearly all of the bold assertions and\nchange guidance in this framework are rarely from appropriate sources, and when\nthey are, they represent a one-sided take from the existing body of evidence. I\nwill follow up with another comment, covering this issue in more detail.\n\nYou must reject this framework and go back to the drawing board.",

My\ndaughters both love math and always excelled in their studies but were not given\nthe opportunity in 8th grade to take Algebra. They both know they want to pursue\na college degree in a STEM field and will need to complete Calculus in 12th\ngrade in order to be competitive for the programs they are interested in.\nFinding a path for them to be able to reach Calculus in 12th grade has not been\neasy. My older daughter took Algebra online ahead of 9th grade through a paid\nonline course and then had to pass an exam administered by the district in order\nto take Geometry as a 9th grader. My younger daughter plans to study and\nhopefully pass a course in PreCalculus in the summer between 11th and 12th grade\nin order to take Calculus in 12th grade. We need a California math framework\nthat is data-driven, research-proven, and teacher-supported, and does not leave\nour students behind the rest of the nation. ",

As a parent of a rising 6th grader and a rising 5th grader I am\nflabbergasted that the goal is not to try to get more children into Algebra in\n8th grade. We should be aiming higher and raising the bar rather than putting\nCalifornia children at a competitive disadvantage. Please allow children that\nare ready to progress to keep growing and work on getting more children into 8th\ngrade Algebra, not preventing them from achieving more.",

    "Comments": "It is extremely troubling that the SBE is rushing this egregiously\nflawed document through under cover of darkness, given it impacts millions of\nchildren.\n\nI would like to comment on just a few of the proposed CMF\u2019s errors:\n\n1) Rampant citation misrepresentation: Many of the documents\u2019 assertions are\nquite simply hard to believe. They were justified via citations to other papers.\nIn essentially all cases, the papers were seriously misrepresented in the CMF.\nSome even had conclusions opposite to what was said in the CMF. The solution is\nto remove all references to non-academic research, since those papers have NO\nstandards and are not good references for a math framework that is going to\naffect millions of children. The next step is to replace all references that are\nnot peer reviewed academic papers with references to actual research. Can\u2019t find\nany? Well you have your answer!\n\n2) Gross conflict of interest: CMF author(s) stand to profit from\nrecommendations made in the document (eg, selling recommended curriculum). This\npresents a significant conflict of interest. Probably, it is illegal.\n\n3) Misrepresentation of data science field: The authors conflate statistics and\ndata science; they are not the same. Also, data science undergraduate degrees\nrequire calculus, and data science jobs at Spotify, Salesforce, Amazon, Dropbox,\nGoogle, LinkedIn, etc. require degrees in fields such as math, economics,\nengineering, computer science, etc., and these require calculus and linear\nalgebra. Overall, the field and its prerequisites are grossly misrepresented.\n\nWorse, The CMF writing team has ignored the explicit warnings by SBE member\nPatricia Rucker that bias towards data science over other math routes is\nforbidden.\n\n4) Activism and jargon vs substance: The document contains lengthy passages\nhaving little to do with math content and graphics giving no relevant\ninformation.

    "Comments": "The mathematics framework for K-12 students should state that math\ninstructions and curriculum used in public school would have no influence or\nindoctrination from, or association with, political viewpoints and goals toward\nsocial justice, and racial equity. Correlation is not causation. Just as the\nSuper Bowl Indicator is neither believable nor accurate, the correlation between\nstudents\u2019 racial makeup and math performance can not be used to argue that race\nis a factor in students\u2019 math or academic performance. If we gather enough data,\nwe may find a strong positive correlation between math performance and religion,\nor math performance and hair color, or math performance and students\u2019 favorite\nsport or hobby. But it would be unwise for us to try to achieve equity in\nreligion, hair color, sports or hobby. Rather, students\u2019 performance is the\nresult of numerous factors, including family dynamic, family value and attitude\nabout education, students\u2019 personal motivation, students\u2019 academic abilities,\nstudent\u2019s time living in the US, students\u2019 study habits and sturdy time,\nparents\u2019 involvement in students\u2019 daily learning, teaching effectiveness at\nschools, etc. Every kid is different, so we should not strive for equalized\noutcome. Some kids will be good in math, and some won\u2019t, just like some will be\ngood in language arts and some won\u2019t. Let those who wish to study advanced\nmaterials do so, and let others who only wish to learn the basics do as they\nwish. Taxpayers of CA should find schools that teach useful and practical math\nin grades k-12 to prepare students for career or higher education, and give\nequal access and learning opportunity to all students at public schools;\ntaxpayers should not fund educational framework or curriculum that is tied to\nsocial justice, racial equity, social activism, or political viewpoints\u002fbias.

    "Comments": "I am floored as a parent of two age school children in San\nFrancisco that the state of California would consider this abomination of a\nframework at this point in time, post pandemic when we are trying to recoup\nlearning loss. One more thing to lower standards and make our kids LAST. How\ndoes the state expect to recoup this loss by adding a more complex system of\ninstruction? LooK at the test scores but more importantly listen to teachers and\nparents. Trust me when I tell you the struggles of our rising 5th grader not\nknowing his times tables! I directly attribute this to the curriculum trying to\ndo too many things at once - multiple concepts and approaches and hardly any\nmemorization to get it into long term memory. I\u2019m pleading with you all to\nsimplify this. It\u2019s already over engineered! And you\u2019re going to make it worse.\nRight now we go through nightly pain of teaching \u201cmath facts\u201d and concepts\ninstead of the actual practicing problems. This overtaxes the young child\u2019s\nbrain to the point where when faced with choices, they don\u2019t know which approach\nto take. PLEASE don\u2019t do this!! You are confusing our students\n\nLoveless states:\n\u201cBig ideas, open-ended tasks, collaborative problem solving, lessons on mindset,\nand inquiry-based teaching\u2014these are foundational to the framework.\n\nThe proposed California Math Framework not only ignores key expectations of the\nstate\u2019s math standards, but it also distorts or redefines them to serve a reform\nagenda. The standards call for students to know \u201cfrom memory\u201d basic addition\nfacts by the end of 2nd grade and multiplication facts by the end of 3rd grade.\nBut the framework refers to developing fluency with basic facts as a major topic\nof 4th through 6th grades. Fluency is redefined to disregard speed. Instruction\non standard algorithms is delayed by interpreting the grades for culminating\nstandards as the grades in which standard algorithms are first encountered.\nCalifornia\u2019s students will be taught the standard algorithm for division years\nafter the rest of the world.\u201d",

Why do you think that is??? Because parents who\nhave children in San Francisco public schools know that in order for their\nchildren to succeed and be ready for High School math they need to pay for after\nschool lessons. This alone makes 'EQUITY' a joke. You will never achieve equity,\nit's a ridiculous idea to try and achieve. Equal opportunity needs to be the\nfocus and Item 11 will do just the opposite. Shame on anyone who thinks lowering\nstandards is a good idea. It's racist in nature. Everyone voting on this item\nshould do research on the results that recently came out regarding San\nFrancisco's elimination of 8th grade algebra. It's dismal. If this passes,\neveryone who voted in favor will be on the wrong side of history. ",

    "Comments": "Eliminating the opportunity for 8th graders in California public\nschools to take Algebra will have devastating consequences for kids who like\nmath.\n\nMy child was a student in SFUSD K-8 schools and was so bored by the math\ncurriculum that we ended up having to supplement from 2-8th grades.\n\nSlowing down the curriculum was meant to bring more students along the math\npath, and she put a ton of effort into helping her classmates, but studies show\nthis experimental policy has failed the kids it was meant to help.\n\nThe idea that slowing down the curriculum for all kids instead of meeting\nindividual kids where their abilities lie will leave California\u2019s public school\nstudents at a disadvantage when competing for degrees and jobs that require math\nskill.\n\nFor high school we decided to leave our district in favor of a private school as\ndid many families who have the resources to opt out.\n\nAs more families experience this slower math curriculum and opt out when they\ncan, CA public schools will become a second class education option- one that\nwill not prepare students to compete in a job market that increasingly favors\ndegrees in math and science.\n\nPlease do not adopt this horrible policy. Instead put resources into meeting all\nchildren where they\u2019re at.\n\nThank you,\nKelly Inouye\n\n",

My San Francisco Unified school\ndistrict has this policy in place and it is utterly against the wishes of the\nparent community. All students who are ready should be able to take an algebra\nclass in 8th grade. My current 9th grader was forced by this policy to take an\nextra math course virtually (UC Scout) to place out of algebra. Clearly she was\nready to do the coursework as she passed easily and obtained credit from the\ndistrict. It only cost us $895 we paid out of pocket. Pity the families who\ncannot afford that for their children. Do not allow this to become California\npolicy!!!",

They are forced to\ntake algebra during their ninth grade year and compress their geometry, algebra\n2, or their pre-Calc learning into shortened periods of time so that they can\nachieve their goal of taking AP calculus during senior year, or AP statistics.\nThis means that there are mathematics courses that are not given the year long\ntime for a student to truly learn that particular math, and it means the student\nhas to undergo an incredibly stressful situation to compact a math course into a\nshort amount of time. Please do not use San Francisco unified as an example of\n\u201cwhere it works\u201d. Instead, use us as an example of what not to do, which is\neradicate eighth grade algebra. It didn\u2019t work.

In\nall these years, he has not once been challenged in math, and that's not per\nlack of motivation-- he's a straight A student. He used to love math in\nelementary school, but it's been boring to him all through middle school and\nespecially this past year in 8th grade. Math is now his least favorite subject,\neven though he likes his math teacher. Am not impressed by what SFUSD did to\nmath. This fall, we're having him leave SFUSD in order to provide him a\nchallenging academic environment. If you don't challenge the students that want\nto be challenged, you get SFUSD, a district where anyone with means, takes their\nkids out by middle school and high school.",

Moreover, it ought to set standards of\nexcellence in line with what we know can be done from international experience\nof best-in-class math education systems like that of Singapore.\n\nI urge the state to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new\nframework that addresses the points made here:\nhttps:\u002f\u002fwww.educationnext.org\u002fcalifornias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up\u002f?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__https:\u002f\u002fwww.educationnext.org\u002fcalifornias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up\u002f?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YE3fhPCaUr_yZlSq8gSIYFjQBB0NAc-6cGyTAGJWl1MWgjaVcqmmAeW0V_3u9BtEWr-UidTgD7MtYALpU0lDAQ$]\n\nand by the thousands of mathematicians and educational professionals who have\nsigned open letters opposing the framework.",

    "Comments": "The state Board of Education, should dispense with the proposed\nelimination of algebra in the eighth grade. For high schoolers to be able to\ntake the Calculus AP AB they needed to have algebra in eighth grade to allow\nenough time for the preparatory coursework for the AP course. If they want to\ntake the Calculus AP BC they would need to have taken algebra in seventh grade.\nCalifornia\u2019s math curriculum should allow for this and allow children who are\nready to take algebra in the seventh and eighth grade to do so. Having calculus\nin high school set up students in college to take more advanced math classes\ncritical for STEM majors. ",

Private school kids had no such\nstruggle and were offered the curriculum in their schools.\n\nThis change in the name of 'equity' really just hurts the people it's ostensibly\ntrying to help, by putting roadblocks in the way of students who have fewer\nresources to try and get past them, and by holding them back while the wealthy\nprivileged have access to more advanced learning opportunities.\n\nEquity shouldn't mean lowering the bar to hold kids back to the lowest level.

If the goal is to find a path to retain motivated children and their\nfamilies in CA public schools, then DO NOT ADOPT THIS FRAMEWORK. Families and\nkids who want their kids to pursue careers in STEM would leave the public\nschools in droves. And as a result, the public school system will be more\ndecimated. You want to turn the tide on enrollment? Offer more rigor, not less,\nmake more schools like magnate schools instead of watering down the most\nfundament discipline in STEM education. MATH.\n\nFinally, Jo Boaler is a grifter who charges poor schools in Ventura $5,000 an\nhour. By adopting this, your legitimizing her grift and the public school system\nand the kids in the public schools in California will suffer as a result. DO NOT\nDUMB DOWN MATH!\n\n",

Not allowing students the opportunity to\ntake Algebra in 8th grade sets them back in highschool. The San Francisco\nUnified Math curriculum needs to change and include Algebra for all 8th graders.\nIf 8th graders do not receive algebra they will be required to take extra math\ncourses in highschool in order to graduate with Calculus which if taken senior\nyear helps keep their college applications competitive. Also, students who wish\nto pursue a STEM career will be required to take Calculus in college and they\nneed the exposure to the material in highschool. The current San Francisco\nUnified curriculum should not be a standard for the state because it is flawed\nputting our public middle school students at a disadvantage. San Francisco\nUnified needs to change their math curriculum to include 8th grade Algebra and\nother school districts that offer 8th grade Algebra should be allowed to\ncontinue to offer it. ",

    "Comments": "I write this letter to oppose the proposed California Math\nFramework. My comments are a distillation of a lengthier analysis presented in\nthe Spring 2023 issue of Education Next, 'California's New Math Framework\nDoesn't Add Up.'\n\nThe framework\u2019s stated purpose is \u201cto support implementation of the California\nCommon Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM).\u201d The framework\nundermines the standards, in some cases directly contradicting them.\n\nThe framework states: \u201cAttaining fluency with multiplication and division within\n100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students\u2019 work.\u201d How\ncan that be? If students know multiplication facts \u201cfrom memory\u201d at the end of\nthird grade\u2014as stipulated in the state standards--why would they still be\nworking on basic fact fluency in the upper elementary grades? But the claim is\nrepeated: \u201cAcquiring fluency with multiplication facts begins in third grade and\ndevelopment continues in grades four and five.\u201d (pg. 83)\n\nNote that California\u2019s 2013 math framework contained almost the exact same\nwording to describe third grade expectations. \u201cMultiplication and division are\nnew concepts in grade three, and reaching fluency with these operations within\n100 represents a major portion of students\u2019 work. By the end of grade three,\nstudents also know all products of two one-digit numbers from memory (3.OA.7 ).\u201d\nA major portion of 3rd grade work will now become a major portion of the work in\nupper elementary grades. What a step backwards!\n\nWhat does fluent mean? The 2013 framework offers a clear definition, consistent\nwith other states that adopted Common Core. \u201cThe word fluent is used in the\nstandards to mean \u2018reasonably fast and accurate\u2019 and possessing the ability to\nuse certain facts and procedures with enough facility that using such knowledge\ndoes not slow down or derail the problem solver as he or she works on more\ncomplex problems.\u201d The new framework redefines fluency to discourage an emphasis\non speed.\n\nThe California Common Core Math Standards call for students to demonstrate an\nunderstanding of, and the ability to use, the standard algorithms of addition\nand subtraction by the end of fourth grade, multiplication by the end of fifth\ngrade, and division by the end of sixth grade. These are culminating standards,\nnot ironclad rules regarding when standard algorithms can and cannot be taught.\n\nThe proposed math framework interprets these standards as banning the teaching\nof standard algorithms before the culminating grade, a false interpretation\nexplicitly debunked by Jason Zimba, one of the Common Core co-authors. If this\nframework is adopted, California\u2019s students will encounter the standard division\nalgorithm for the first time in sixth grade, years after most of the world has\nattained mastery.\n\nPlease reject the proposed framework.\n\n",

    "Comments": "Concerning the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework: It\nappears that California wants to further dumb down its education for the purpose\nof ensuring that black students do not feel less intelligent. This is equity,\nmeaning no one advances past another. Unfortunately, we cannot be made equally\nintelligent; instead, schools can only ensure that no one has the opportunity to\nbecome more so. This equity push will come at a cost to America. America doesn't\nneed every one of its citizens to be pros at math, but it needs some to be pros\nat it. Technology drives our civilization now, not the mule. We need smart\npeople, and we need our schools to make them smart, not to make them happy.",

The anti-merit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal\noutcomes, would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public\neducation.\n\nTake home message, when you need surgery in hospital, you wouldn\u2019t want\nequity-hired or diversity-hired doctors to do surgery for you, you want to have\nthe most competent doctors.

    "Comments": "I urge adoption of the Revised Draft of the Mathematics Framework.\nThis revised document provides long-awaited guidance for educators and\ndistricts. It prioritizes equitable teaching strategies and retains a focus on\nsocial justice. It presents a solid research base while also acknowledging the\nneed for further study of high school pathways. Its focus on big ideas provides\na way for educators to plan and implement instruction effectively. The three-\ndimensional schema provides a conceptual frame for the why (Drivers of\nInvestigation), how (Standards for Mathematical Practice), and what (Content\nConnections) of mathematics instruction, bringing coherence to how we think\nabout, plan, and implement learning experiences for our students.\nWe have learned from past efforts. We know more about how students learn and the\ncontexts in and conditions under which they thrive. We know more about effective\nteaching practices. This knowledge is reflected in the revised document. The\nMathematics Framework in its latest iteration is future forward, foretelling\npowerful mathematics teaching and learning ahead.\n\n\n\n",

    "Comments": "The new high school Data Science pathway is deeply flawed. It is\nintended as a route for students who are challenged by algebra to learn some\nconcepts related to real world data science in a less mathematically focused\nway. In principle this may be a reasonable goal for some students, but the\nactual curriculum here isn't much more than a repeat of data representation\nideas from earlier grades. It utterly fails to build the conceptual framework\nfor students to apply mathematical \u002f quantitative reasoning to both abstract and\nreal world physical phenomena.\n\nMore directly: students who study this pathway instead of Algebra II \u002f\nIntegrated Math III will be hopelessly behind their peers when they enter\ncolleges and universities in California or elsewhere. It is deeply ironic that\nthis curriculum is called 'Introduction to Data Science', when any students\nentering any University of California campus from this pathway will have to take\nAT LEAST TWO algebra \u002f precalculus classes before other prerequisites for the\nintroductory Data Sciences courses! This will negatively impact time-to-degree\nand college readiness for potentially thousands of students.\n\nMost worrying: I fear that the California high schools with fewer resources will\nbe tempted to offer the Data Science pathway INSTEAD of Algebra II \u002f Integrated\nMath III. Students at such high schools are already seriously disadvantaged;\nthis policy will only serve to increase the inequality and disadvantage those\nstudents now suffer.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTodd Kemp, PhD\nProfessor of Mathematics\nFounding Faculty of the Halicioglu Data Science Institute\nUC San Diego.",

    "Comments": "The proposed math curriculum in the education system can have\nseveral potential downsides:\n\n1. Weakening foundational skills: The Proposed Math curriculum may result in a\ndiminished emphasis on foundational math skills. These skills are crucial for\nadvanced mathematical concepts and real-world applications. Weaker foundations\ncan hinder students' abilities to pursue careers in STEM fields and may limit\ntheir overall mathematical competence.\n\n2. Reduced problem-solving abilities: Rigorous math education fosters critical\nthinking and problem-solving skills. By diluting the curriculum, students may\nmiss out on opportunities to develop their analytical and logical reasoning\nabilities. This can have long-term consequences, as problem-solving skills are\nessential in various academic disciplines and in everyday life.\n\n3. Limited preparedness for higher education: A less rigorous math curriculum\nmay inadequately prepare students for the challenges they will encounter in\nhigher education. Many disciplines, including engineering, computer science,\neconomics, and physics, require strong mathematical foundations. Students may\nstruggle to succeed in these fields if they haven't received a rigorous math\neducation in their earlier years.\n\n4. Impact on international competitiveness: This curriculum may negatively\nimpact a country's competitiveness on the global stage. In an increasingly\ninterconnected world, proficiency in mathematics is crucial for scientific\nresearch, technological innovation, and economic growth. This framework will\nimpact out state of California and then USA will produce graduates who are less\nequipped to compete internationally in these domains.\n\n5. Disparity in education quality: The proposed math curriculum may exacerbate\nexisting disparities in education quality. Students from disadvantaged\nbackgrounds may be disproportionately affected, as they often rely on education\nsystems to provide them with opportunities to bridge the socio-economic gap.\nWeaker math education can perpetuate inequality by limiting their access to\nhigh-paying careers and advanced educational opportunities.\n\n6. Teacher preparedness and professional development: Implementing this Math\ncurriculum may require significant changes in teaching methodologies,\ninstructional resources, and professional development for teachers. Adequate\ntraining and support for educators are essential to ensure they can effectively\nadapt their teaching strategies. Insufficient preparation can hinder teachers'\nability to deliver quality math education, further compromising students'\nlearning outcomes.",

The Revised Draft also recommends\nshifting from the use of remedial classes to a focus on acceleration and\nenrichment opportunities to better support all students.\n\nEducators, districts, schools, parents, and families use the CA Mathematics\nFramework to guide their math instructional programs, design professional\ndevelopment to build capacity across district systems, inform curriculum\nselection, and advocate for research-based math instruction that meets the needs\nof all learners. I encourage the SBE to vote to approve the 2023 Mathematics\nFramework to support CA districts in moving forward and creating a strong\nfoundation for the field of mathematics education in California for the next\neight years until the next framework is written and adopted.

    "Comments": "The proposed mathematics framework is a looming disaster for\nCalifornia students. If approved, it will further sink California K-12\nmathematics education below the lowly depths to which it has already sunk.\n\nBased on my 46 years of experience working in the most mathematically intense\nsegment of the aerospace industry, I can assure you that the image of\nmathematics held by the authors of this framework is so alien to the reality of\nmathematics as it is practiced by those of us who actually do it for a living\nthat it is barely recognizable let alone a model for mathematics instruction.\nFirst of all, math has nothing whatsoever do with fashionable Edu-speak\nobsessions such as race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, etc. In\nfact, several of the attributes of mathematics that make it so appealing to its\npractitioners worldwide are that it is universal, deals with truths that cannot\nbe refuted, is undemocratic (does not depend on majority consensus for its\nveracity), and excludes appeals to authority as grounds for the acceptance of\nits conclusions. Another aspect of the framework that I find particularly\nobjectionable is the false assertion, permeating the framework, that math has to\nbe \u201crelevant\u201d to students\u2019 life experiences in order to be learned by them.\nNothing could be farther from the truth. The fact is, that if competently\ntaught, math is seen by most students to be an intrinsically fascinating subject\nin its own right, no matter which side of the tracks they call home. And this\ncoming from me, a lifetime practitioner of applied, rather than pure,\nmathematics.\n\nCalifornia colleges of engineering are enrolling higher and higher proportions\nof foreign students who do not suffer from the handicap imposed upon American\nstudents by advocates of the concepts embodied in the proposed K-12 mathematics\nframework because fewer and fewer California students are acquiring the\nessential traditional math skills in K-12 necessary to handle twenty-first\ncentury engineering curricula.\n\nAt greatest risk from the proposed framework are students from poor families,\nbecause their parents cannot afford to send them to Kumon or the Russian School\nof Mathematics \u2013 private businesses that thrive on successfully providing\nstudents with learning that compensates for the inadequacies of public school\nmathematics instruction, a state of affairs that also contributes significantly\nto the skewing of statistical studies of mathematics education outcomes in favor\nof wealthier students.\n\nCalifornia deserves better. I urge you to reject the proposed mathematics\nframework.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Comments": "I believe the proposed Calif. Math Framework (CMF) would be HARMFUL\nto students, especially HARMFUL TO BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN. I say this as (a)\na retired UC Davis professor who has taught math, statistics and computer\nscience, and (b) as a lifelong activist on behalf of URMs (underrepresented\nminorities), starting with my work in 1968 on the congressional campaign of\nMyrlie Evers, a historic Black figure, my term as Chair of the UCD faculty\nAffirmative Action Committee, and so on. I make the following brief points:\n\n1. The document is horribly biased, as seen in its failure to correct numerous\nserious factual errors pointed out after the earlier version was released; the\nfailure to correct FACTUAL errors cannot be anything but deliberate. It has more\nthan 25 citations of the research of ONE single person, with NO references to\nwork by critics of the proposal. No critics were members of the advisory\ncommittee. The main concession made by the revised document seems to be\nmollifying parents who were worried their children would not be able to take\ncalculus; those of us with broader concerns about the curriculum as a whole were\nignored.\n\n2. The negative impact on URM children, who are the most vulnerable in our\nsociety, would be devastating.The courses in data science and the like would be\nwatered down to the point of uselessness (see below), and URMs would be shunted\ninto these classes, which would be dominated by URMs. The classes would be known\nto the students as 'Black and Latino math,' a horribly stigmatizing situation.\nThis ideologically-based playing with URM lives is absolutely unconscionable.\n\n3. I have long experience teaching statistics, and can say unequivocally that\nthe data science curricula would be useless. Yes, one can certainly teach data\nscience without calculus, but Algebra 2 is an indispensable prerequisite. Data\nscience is meaningless without a firm grasp of the concept of the slope of a\nline. I've looked at the LAUSD version of a data science curriculum, and is both\nsuperficial and riddled with conceptual errors. The UCLA lecturer who created\nthe curriculum has also made serious conceptual errors in a YouTube video on\ncollege admissions.\n\n4. That last ;point illustrates a more general principle: Data science is a\nhighly nuanced field, which is easy to misuse. Even if the curriculum were\nrevised to require Algebra 2, it would be quite difficult to obtain teachers\nwith the needed depth in DS; a short training course would not suffice.\n\nI'm a Californian, born and raised, with a lifetime devotion to teaching. I have\neven taught municipal ESL courses, and a brief supplementary math course for\n5th-graders at a local elementary school. And I've been fortunate to have won\nsome teaching awards. I've thought long and hard about how young people learn\nmath, especially URMs, and it pains me to see California kids being treated this\nway. Please do NOT approve this plan.\n",

    "Comments": "CA seems to be all set to make exactly the same disastrous mistake\nwith Math that the US made for 40 years with reading \u2013 choosing an ideological\napproach with very weak evidence and ignoring a strong, evidence-based approach.\nIn that instance the state, like the rest of the US, went down the Whole\nLanguage\u002fBalanced Literacy path, rather than the strong, evidence-based Science\nof Reading path.\n\nIt is pertinent to note in this context that while NY has apologized for its use\nof Balanced Literacy and has committed to Science of Reading, CA persists in\nusing its failed methods to teach reading.\n\nSo I suppose one should not be surprised that CA, with some of the lowest math\nachievement in the nation, now intends to make matters worse, with this dumbing\ndown of math standards, and the insertion of \u201cequity\u201d and \u201csocial justice\u201d\nrather than math achievement, as its guiding star.\n\nThe framework makes claims that are blatantly false, such as ignoring research\non the importance of math fluency ie: memorization of key facts and procedures;\nclaiming that \u201creaching fluency with multiplication and division within 100\nrepresents a major portion of upper elementary grade students\u2019 work\u201d whereas the\nCommon Core standards actually requires this fluency by third grade; claiming\nthat having students invent algorithms for basic operations is \u201cproductive\nstruggle\u201d rather than a proven waste of time etc ad nauseum.\n\nBrian Conrad, Stanford math professor, has analyzed the citations in the\nframework, and shows that the findings of many studies are misrepresented.\n\nAn analysis of the citations ALSO shows that the actual best math ed practices\nare NOT cited in the framework \u2013 instead, ideological and weak evidence is given\npriority.\n\nProof is in this excerpt from\nhttps:\u002f\u002fwww.educationnext.org\u002fcalifornias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up\u002f\n[https:\u002f\u002furldefense.com\u002fv3\u002f__https:\u002f\u002fwww.educationnext.org\u002fcalifornias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up\u002f__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!etGFShMeBtebgN8e5IkTXFniusIpRL146k6GTPi_9b8NhoIW6QE7_hWgUbd3dbcv7GXFinIN6mFUU8fpy_ktOEU$]\n-\n\n\u201cThe What Works Clearinghouse, housed within the federal Institute of Education\nSciences, publishes practice guides for educators. The guides aim to provide\nconcise summaries of high-quality research on various topics. A panel of experts\nconducts a search of the research literature and screens studies for quality,\nfollowing strict protocols. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies are\nfavored because of their ability to estimate causal effects. The panel\nsummarizes the results, linking each recommendation to supporting studies. The\npractice guides present the best scientifically sound evidence on causal\nrelationships in teaching and learning.\nHow many of the studies cited in the practice guides are also cited in the\nframework? To find out, I searched the framework for citations to the studies\ncited by the four practice guides most relevant to K\u201312 math instruction. Here\nare the results:\n\n\nAssisting Students Struggling with Mathematics: Intervention in the Elementary\nGrades\n(2021) 0 out of 43 studies\nTeaching Strategies for Improving Algebra Knowledge in Middle and High School\nStudents\n(2015, revised 2019) 0 out of 12 studies\nImproving Mathematical Problem Solving in Grades 4 Through 8\n(2012) 0 out of 37 studies\nDeveloping Effective Fractions Instruction for Kindergarten Through 8th Grade\n(2010) 1 out of 22 studies\n\nEnd of excerpt\n\n\nIn short, the Framework is an ideological document that will push CA students\neven further down their already abysmal performance levels. Who will suffer?\nAffluent parents and Asians of all income levels will move heaven and earth and\nuse outside resources to make sure their children learn math to the level\nneeded. They will learn math, untainted by \u201csocial justice\u201d propaganda and\nequity dumbing down.\n\nIt is the low income students this Framework so piously claims to want to help\nwho will be further crushed by it.\n",

    "Comments": "The math framework revision is based on gravely flawed research or\nin some cases no research at all. The framework recommends fairly drastic\nchanges that are counterintuitive, and therefore the burden of proof falls on\nthe recommenders to justify the changes. I believe that burden has not been met.\nThe changes are not innocuous. I believe they will hurt all populations,\nincluding advanced learners and underserved communities. The treatment of\ncertain subjects in the proposed high school courses do not satisfy the rigorous\nrequirements the UC system demands. Students of those subjects will be\nunwittingly and undeservedly unprepared for college.\n\nI am a proponent of progressive education, but it must be based on solid\nresearch. This framework must be rejected. At this stage, I would hope that the\nnext draft be given to a different set of authors who might be more capable of\nunderstanding the existing academic literature.

The Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools is still\nRIDDLED WITH CITATION ERRORS. The authors' claims are NOT SUPPORTED BY VALID\nEVIDENCE.\n\nI have been a math teacher in SFUSD for several years now. This is what I've\nseen over the past 10 years: An increased number of students are entering 9th\ngrade without having their multiplication facts memorized, without the ability\nto perform operations with positive and negative integers, decimals, and\nfractions, without the ability to solve one-step, two-step, and muti-step\nequations (even with integers!), and without the ability to work independently.\nThis has had a catastrophically negative effect on high school mathematics.\n\nThe achievement gap has dramatically grown and so has the bipolarity within our\nclasses. We\u2019re now forced to differentiate our instruction over *multiple*\nyears; students who are entering 9th grade with less than a 5th grade level of\nmath competency are grouped with students who are ready for precalculus. No one\nis getting the time, practice, and attention they need to thrive.",

    "Comments": "I\u2019m a once math major, now working in tech\u002fhealthcare, and I credit\nthat largely to the high quality, high expectations math education I had access\nto as a child in California. However, since 2012, the fraction of 13 year olds\ntaking algebra has declined from 34% to 24%. The proposed framework is a step\nbackwards, and poorly researched.\nI\u2019m pleased with some of the changes \u2013 some culture war language was removed,\nexplicit support for San Francisco\u2019s de-tracking experiments was removed and the\nrecommendations to de-track without acceleration were softened, following\ndebunking of the research that initially prompted them, and after the authors of\nresearch that was misrepresented spoke out. However, the fixes are very ad hoc\nand leave the framework inconsistent.\nThe language around tracking is especially incoherent. The framework favors\n\u201cgrouping\u201d in which students are assigned to classes of their skill level, but\nit\u2019s not considered tracking as it\u2019s not permanent. But authors seem to have\nreservation about this, as the framework pushes to delay grouping as late as\npossible \u2013 see \u201cProductive Strategies for Teaching Diverse Students\u201d. This is\njustified on the basis that \u201cengagement can fluctuate significantly during\nadolescent years\u201d; but that would suggest grouping should be delayed until\nadulthood. Bizarrely, immediately after this remark, it suggests that high\nachieving students should be able to \u201cto accelerate at any time\u201d but doesn\u2019t\ndistinguish that from grouping.\nThe framework also discourages tracking compared to pathways because tracking\nlocks in students to a certain set of courses in their future. Later, it\nrecommends that students be placed into \u201cpathways\u201d, which are sets of courses\nstudents plan to take in the future based on ability and interest.\n\nThe recommendations around this topic, simply put, are very confused.\n\nStudents are individuals who vary from one another, and any kind of one size\nfits all approach is silly, and will fail some of the children. Grouping should\nbegin as soon as they show any differences in educational needs.",

    "Comments": " Mathematics instruction in California can be more effective and\nequitable. In many CA districts, current teaching practices have resulted in\nonly one-third of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures\nacross the state. Additionally, most students are being pushed out of high-level\npathways at a young age. Lessons are often based on routine tasks taught with\noutdated methods, using narrow, procedural questions. This has had real\nconsequences. Today, less than half of California students satisfy A-G\nrequirements, thus limiting their choices and opportunities for college and\ncareers. California has insufficient educators qualified to work in STEM. It has\nto hire thousands of people from other countries to address needs every year.\n\nMath education has historically been a gatekeeper to college and career success,\npreventing first-generation college-bound students, Black and Latine students,\nstudents with disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to\n4-year colleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers.\n\nThese programs are part of a legacy of inequitable educational programs which\nuse standardized tests and gifted programming to exclude Black students from\ngifted classrooms and relegate English Learner students into low-level\neducational pathways at an early age. These tests, often given in elementary\nschool, have been used to sort label students as those who are 'good at math'\nand those who are not, and often determine who and who are not 'college\nmaterial.'\n\nThe revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics.\n\nStudents will be taught through rich, engaging problems highlighting\nmathematical ideas and connections.\nPathways will be opened up so more students can learn algebra and take\nhigher-level math coursework.\nA mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice. Students will\nbe able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses\nthat enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve.\n\nReplacement of outdated tracking methods that segregated students into low-level\nremedial classes - with acceleration and enrichment opportunities open to more\nstudents.\n\nSchools have been implementing the ideas in the framework for many years, based\non extensive scientific evidence, and have shown higher and more equitable\noutcomes.\n\nDecades of research and practice have demonstrated there are better models for\nmath instruction. Methods that are creative, inclusive, culturally responsive,\nchallenging, and affirming for all students and that engage students more\neffectively. Strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to\nmake meaning, think critically, and progress at their own pace.\n\nThe revised framework was designed by a committee of 20 elected educators and\nfive writers and has gone through a two-year process of public comments and\nrevisions. As of April 2023, over 66 organizations and 2,800 educators,\nresearchers and parents signed a letter of support for the California Math\nFramework.\n\nThey include:\n\nThe California County Offices of Education\nThe California Mathematics Council\nThe National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)\nThe National Council for Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM)\nJust Equations\nTODOS \u2013 Organization for Excellence and Equity in Mathematics\nEducation Trust-West\nCenter for Equity for English Learners at Loyola Marymount University\nCalifornia Partnership for Math and Science Education",

The\napproach outlined in the framework is equitable, effective, conceptual, and\nempowering for students. The framework will support CA mathematics teachers,\nstudents, and families with a more humanizing approach to mathematics that\nsupports students to develop deep, conceptual understanding of content, to\nconnect it to their lives and to other subjects, and to author their own ideas.",

    "Comments": "Dear Members of the Board of Education,\n\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding certain educational frameworks\nthat have been implemented and their potential ramifications on the quality of\npublic education in our state. As a concerned citizen invested in the well-being\nof our education system, I believe it is crucial to address these issues to\nensure the future success of our students.\n\nFirstly, I would like to draw your attention to the concept of an 'anti-merit\nstatewide framework.' While I understand the importance of promoting equality in\neducation, it is essential to strike a balance between providing equal\nopportunities and maintaining high academic standards. Lowering standards in the\nname of equal outcomes could potentially compromise the quality of education our\nstudents receive. I kindly request that the Board of Education carefully\nconsiders the long-term effects of any policy changes and strives to find a\nmiddle ground that promotes both equality and excellence in education.\n\nSecondly, I would like to emphasize the increasing need for competent engineers,\nscientists, mathematicians, and other STEM talents in our society. The\nadvancements and challenges of the modern world necessitate a strong focus on\nSTEM education. It is crucial that our public education system provides students\nwith the necessary skills and knowledge in these fields. Therefore, I urge the\nBoard of Education to prioritize and invest in quality STEM education, ensuring\nthat our students are well-prepared to tackle the demands of the future.\n\nLastly, I would like to express my reservations regarding an 'equity-themed math\nframework.' While it is important to address systemic inequalities and foster\ninclusive learning environments, it is equally essential to maintain a rigorous\nand balanced approach to mathematics education. Incorporating diverse\nperspectives and real-life applications in math can enhance students'\nunderstanding and engagement. However, it is imperative to ensure that any\nequity-focused frameworks do not compromise the development of fundamental\nmathematical skills. I kindly request the Board of Education to approach these\nframeworks with careful consideration and maintain a strong emphasis on\nmathematical excellence while promoting equity objectives.\n\nI believe that our education system plays a pivotal role in shaping the future\nof our society. By addressing these concerns and finding a balance between\nequality and excellence, we can provide our students with a high-quality\neducation that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities they will\nface.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I trust that the Board of Education\nwill give due attention to these concerns and take appropriate actions to ensure\nthe best possible educational outcomes for our students.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNirit Luchans\nParent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Comments": "To whom it may concern: I am a high school math teacher in Chino,\nCA. I have taught since 2011. I have been teaching IM1 since 2014. So, my\ncomments are limited to that area since it has been my focus for the past\ndecade. I hope that the comments I've written are read with the understanding\nthat all we want to do as teachers is make it so that students learn, remember\nwhat they learn and we have some fun in the process too! Covid definitely made\nthings clear for us all and sent many packing! I am still here, so are my\ncolleagues, lets work together to figure out the best way to have kids learn\nmath!\n\nHere are my comments\u002fthoughts -\n\nPage 5 line 122; '...create equations to describe situations.' Can weave into\nthe framework the need to understand how creating an equation can lead to\ncreating a function and thus the difference between the two. Thanks!\n\nPage 6 line 131 and 132; 'They compare and contrast linear and exponential\nfunctions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change.' Are you\nreferring to arithmetic and geometric sequences without using those terms? Why?\nAre teachers bothered by them? Please be specific, although I realize this is a\nframework and inherently general, I feel that arithmetic and geometric sequences\nand subsequently, the idea of recursive and explicit forms are a pillar within\nMathematics I. Please refers to them explicitly (no pun intended) to help\nemphasize their importance.\n\nPage 6 line 139; '...assessing how a model fits data. They use regression\ntechniques to describe...' Can someone, somewhere, maybe not here in the\nframework, please talk about the difference between a line of fit (done manually\nusing two points), a line of best fit (done electronically using a graphing\ncalculator like desmos) and the line of regression. Maybe a general statement\nacknowledging that in mathematics we use multiple terms to describe the same\nthing would suffice. Just a thought.\n\nPage 6 lines 143 - 147; Due to the structure of the Integrated Pathway, and the\nnatural emphasis math teachers tend to put on algebra, I feel it is necessary to\nmake it 1000% clear that geometry must be an ESSENTIAL standard in Mathematics\n1. Too often, I have seen geometry placed on the back burner or referred to as a\nnice to know standard. The geometry is where the beauty and art in mathematics\ncomes alive. Teachers don't know how to teach it this way. We need materials\nthat take students from (order could vary) constructing a triangle, to\ntransforming a triangle in the coordinate plane, to using constructions and\ntransformations to prove triangles congruent. Teachers are not teaching it that\nway. They are compartmentalizing these topics and it's a missed opportunity. No\none in public education taught it to me in this way, truly. We need to reeducate\nour educators and get them to buy into the idea that this will have more meaning\nto our students and therefore translate to deeper understanding and long term\nretention. (It's lofty, but I've experienced it in micro moments in the\nclassroom.)\n\nPage 12 line 313; Please, remove the word cancellation. I refrain from saying\nthis word to my students. I use the word simplify, because cancellation refers\nto x\u002fx cancelling each other out, when in fact they are simplifying to 1. Please\nuse simplify instead! Just my two cents!",

    "Comments": " The belief that, if all students were equal, discrimination would\ncease to exist, is an exercise in stupidity. The cure would be worse than the\ndisease. Imagine, a world with eight billion, exactly the same, equal people.\nDumb people have a very difficult time becoming smarter. So, to achieve equity,\neveryone not already a dolt would need to be educated to become doltish.\nEvidently, eradicating discrimination requires leveling the playing field. This\nseems to be the thrust of the 2023 Mathematics framework. Artificially holding\nback advanced students benefits no one but harms all. In an attempt to keep\nfailing math students from feeling bad, they propose holding advanced students\nback. This will not achieve the desired effect. Failing students will still feel\nbad about themselves. Held back students are likely to feel extremely angry at\nthe handicapping.\nThe indoctrination of social justice and identity politics are not Math and when\nembedded in the curriculum, deprive all of a Math education\nThe State Board of Education\u2019s advancing of this Math framework has an agenda\nopposed to merit and excellence. More than likely, they\u2019ve imbibed their own\n\u201cKool Aid.\u201d\n\n",

    "Comments": "There is nothing wrong with merit-based math instruction. The\nachievement gap problem has been intractable because of underlying problem\u002fs--be\nthey social or economic. Teaching for equity does more harm than good,\nespecially since there is no adequately proven record for it. Too many families\nhave already been negatively impacted, particularly Asian Americans. More\nresearch needs to be done before a radical approach like teaching for equity is\nadopted. Given that students are doing poorly and that resources are finite, we\nmust teach to bring out the very best in each student; that means restoring\nmerit.\n\nThe anti-merit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal\noutcomes, would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public\neducation. The promise of America is one of equal opportunities, not equal\noutcomes.\n\nAmerica needs competent engineers, scientists, mathematicians and other STEM\ntalents, more than ever. We simply can't allow public education to keep spinning\ndownwards. Talented students should be acknowledged for their ability to rise\nabove, instead of being held back for the sake of others.\n\nThe equity-themed math framework is playing with fire by conducting an\nideological experiment on our next generation. My siblings and children have\nbeen subjects of untold numbers of FAILED education experiments, including\nbusing, racial quotas, Dream Schools, and a multi-million dollar federal Consent\nDecree.",

    "Comments": "My children have attended school in Fremont Unified School\nDistrict. During elementary school there is no option for accelerated math\nlearning. My kids were offered 'differentiation' and 'deeper learning'. These\noptions are wholly inadequate and unchallenging. It is bad enough that kids that\nare good at math have to be bored in math for all of elementary school, but to\nextend this to middle and high school is ridiculous. The current educational\nsystem convinced my kids that they didn't like math, although they are all very\ngood at it. My middle child is going to be a senior this year, and she finally\nstarted enjoying math in High School, when she was being challenged by the\ncourse work. Teachers, in reality, do not offer more challenging math work to\nkids who are good at math. The revised plan is only paying lip service to\nadvance learners without any substance. California will surely continue to\ndecline in math achievement when you take your best students and offer them the\n'opportunity' to tutor failing students rather than let them learn.",

    "Comments": "I support the approval of the mathematics framework. Equity is an\nimportant goal in math education. During my years in the classroom, I was able\nto provide deep understanding to a wide variety of students enrolled in the same\ncourse. At the same time, their different ways of learning and understanding\noften benefited each other -- the connection between more concrete and more\nabstract thinking became visible to everyone, rather than the struggling\nstudents becoming mired in the concrete, and the stronger students relying on\nmemorization of procedures. Most of my students went on to good four year\ncolleges, including UCs and highly competitive private schools. After high\nschool when I saw them in the community, or when they wrote to me, they would\ntell me that they felt well prepared in a multi-level math class for their\ncollege curriculums.\n\nAnother thing I would like to point out is that standardized tests (aside from\nIB\u002fAP tests) aren't a good measure of what students know because they are\ndesigned to compare students, not as mastery tests. Given that current students\nhad at least two disrupted academic years because of Covid (and don't forget\nthat many lost family members, and\u002for experienced long illnesses of caregivers\nor themselves), test outcomes are even more questionable than usual.\n\nThe point of math is that students learn it deeply enough to succeed in the next\nclass, and like math enough to continue taking it in College, or using it in the\nworkplace. Thus, I reiterate my support of the framework which will help achieve\nthat goal.\n\nSincerely,\nCarol\n(retired teacher)",

    "Comments": "The first hearing of the Diverse Materials Task Force overlooked\nthe important role of African-American communities to the development of\ncurriculum. Governments typically make the mistake of turning to incumbent\nmarket players to address deficiencies that they've created, with a notable lack\nof success. I created ReUNION: Education-Arts-Heritage in 2010 to meet needs\ndiscerned since working wit Professor Sylvia Wynter and Dr. Joyce King on the\nCalifornia History-Social Science Framework in 1989. My presentation Black\nHeritage as Gap Closer to the California Council for the Social Studies in 2008\nrevealed that most schools did not have the materials or training to meet the\nmost basic needs of the framework for African-American students. The 6,000 site\nCalifornia African-American Freedom Trail is part of the curriculum experience\nwe've created along with our four volume Our Roots Run Deep: the Black\nExperience in California, Vols. 1-4, used in schools since 1992. The task force\nshould understand the economic development benefits of relying on local\nsuppliers who match the experiences of California students. For seven years,\nwe've conducted Culture Fridays with students from San Francisco Unified to\nobserve what happens when they are weekly engaged with local arts organizations.\nThe results have been rapid and sensational. Our presentation to the Innovating\nfor Equity symposium in February 2020 demonstrated how to scale these results\nup. California's unique history is the strength of our schools.",

What California needs is more rigorous math education not lower\nstandard in the disguise of the so-call social justice. Students do not grasp\nmath concepts not because they are discriminated but because poor teacher and\nlack of investment! You can keep fool yourself by lowering the standard to\nachieve so-called equity. Why don't you just say high school students only need\nto know 1+1=2, then suddenly every ethnic group is math proficient!!!",

We need to\neliminate the tracking and sorting practices that have become so common,\nadvantaging some while disadvantaging others. We need a framework and system\nthat allows multiple access points and affirms the diversity and backgrounds of\nthe students we serve. We are committed to providing an education free from\nracism and bias and students seeing themselves reflected in the curricula is an\nimportant part of this. We need our students to be taught through rich, engaging\nproblems highlighting mathematical ideas and connections. We need more pathways\nso more students can learn algebra and take higher-level math coursework. We\nneed A mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice so they\nwill be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging\ncourses that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve.\nWe need to replace outdated tracking methods that segregates students into\nlow-level remedial classes - opening acceleration and enrichment opportunities\nto more students.",

    "Comments": "Thank you for considering my comment stating my support of the\nproposed Mathematics Framework. As the Associate Superintendent for the Campbell\nUnion School district I see the need for urgent change in math teaching and\nlearning. Students are increasingly less engaged in math, performance is\nsteadily declining in our state, and students lack access to high quality\ninstruction. The problem is far greater for marginalized students, leading to a\nsignificant and ongoing lack of diversity in math related fields. The framework\nsupports teaching through the use of rich and engaging tasks that offer real\nworld experiences. It creates more opportunity for applied mathematics that will\nhelp shape our future career fields through the recommendation of various\npathways for success. Finally, it is essential that we abolish tracking that\nallows some students to access higher math skills, while others are placed in\nsub-par programs. Please approve this framework so that educators can do the\nwork that we know will lead to better outcomes for California's students. The\ntime for positive change is NOW! ",

This is a direct result of focusing math education\non political propaganda rather than mathematics.\n\nThe proposed math framework is openly anti-merit, it explicitly lowers standards\nto achieve equal outcomes and stresses political issues unrelated to the subject\nof mathematics. Equal outcomes only exist in a cemetery, and not in a classroom\nof living breathing students. People that work hard get the results. People that\nrefuse to work hard do not. This is the American way. If you want your bridges\nto stand, your airplanes to fly, and your doctors to cure you, you should\nunapologetically reject all this equity nonsense.",

As an advocate for quality\nand equity in education and a firm believer in the importance of mathematics in\nshaping the future of our students, I am thrilled to see the efforts being made\nto enhance the mathematics curriculum.\n\nThe adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework is a significant step towards\nproviding our students with a comprehensive and coherent curriculum. By\nemphasizing the development of mathematical proficiency, problem-solving skills,\nand conceptual understanding, the framework ensures that our students are\nequipped with the necessary tools to succeed in the 21st century.\n\nI am particularly pleased to see the integration of technology and real-world\napplications in the revised framework. Bringing relevance to students in today's\ndigital age, is crucial so that our students are not only proficient in\nmathematical concepts but also capable of applying them in practical situations.\n\nFurthermore, it will support our students to have a world size heart and a world\nclass mind. It will open up opportunities for collaboration and exchange of\nideas with educators from around the world. It also provides a clear roadmap for\neducators to follow, facilitating consistency and coherence in mathematics\ninstruction across different schools and districts.\n\nI am also pleased that it includes guidance on approaches to teaching and\nlearning, assessment methods, and professional development for teachers. By\nproviding teachers with the necessary support and resources, the framework\nensures that they are equipped to deliver high-quality mathematics instruction.\nThis, in turn, will have a positive impact on student outcomes and overall\neducational attainment.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics\nFramework for California Public Schools and commend the efforts being made to\nenhance mathematics education. I believe that this will have a profound and\nlasting impact on our all students through equity, equipping them with the\nskills and knowledge they need to excel in mathematics and beyond.\n\nThank you for your dedication to providing equal opportunity for all students to\nlearn. I trust that you will consider my support for the adoption of the 2023\nMathematics Framework and take it into account as you continue to shape the\nfuture of mathematics education in our state.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNancy Qushair",

    "Comments": "A group of Palo Alto parents has sued and won against PAUSD's\npractices of holding back students and forcing them to repeat classes they have\nsuccessfully completed, in violation of EDC 51224.5, 51224.7, and 51228.2. The\nfinal court order on the case, Cohen v. PAUSD (21CV385694), is pending but\nexpected to be completed soon. Similarly, a group of San Francisco parents has\nsued SFUSD on similar grounds for similar practices (FLENTJE v SFUSD,\nCPF-23-517987).\n\nViolating these Ed Codes is an unavoidable consequence of forcing a wide span of\nabilities of 5+ years into the same classroom, especially as students take\nUC-accredited outside education in order to avoid being held back in math.\n\nThe CMF must not suggest practices that encourage districts to break the law in\norder to implement de-tracking. At a minimum, the CMF should warn districts not\nto break the law when implementing its recommendations. This is a very real\nissue.\n",

What we currently know is that the status quo has failed us with\nmathematics education. Let's do something that will change that, and we'll see a\npositive impact that extends to all students.",

    "Comments": "'Chapter 2: Teaching for Equity and Engagement' is about as\nnon-math as possible.\n'encourage equitable outcomes'\n'teaching toward social justice'\nThe government education system has failed miserably at teaching actual math, so\nit's deciding to teach other topics in 'math' class.\nThis is despicable and actual MATH must ONLY be taught in class. \u201cEquity\u201d has\nnothing to do with educating any person on how to perform math equations. No one\nperson is better at math due to their sex, gender, religion, etc. Stick to\nnumerical formulas that are proven science based equations and all persons will\nbe given equal treatment from their respective teachers. Teachers & staff making\nup instructional material instead of proven factual mathematical data are the\nproblem and need to be dealt with accordingly if they are implementing\nnon-related or biased material, aka fired. I oppose all material dealing with\nDEI &\u002for CRT as they have no business in mathematics.",
